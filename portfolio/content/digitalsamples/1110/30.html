directivity plots of the 2007 model (Fig. 5). I believe this anomaly is virtually inaudible because there are no musical recordings with significant signal content at this high a frequency. In other words, the later ones sound the same to me as the first set. On the other hand, it was disappointing that JBL did not indicate the measured performance of the speaker that changed over time in any of the documents associated with the model. To get a better idea what had changed in the LSR6325p over time, audioXpress sent the measurements in this review to JBL and they did respond to me. They stated that the only changes they have made to the speaker is a smoother, darker black finish which is now called the LSR6325p-1 and they have no explanation as to why three of my speakers have that high-frequency peak. As this review is being submitted to print, JBL is trying to track down anything that could have gone wrong. This may be difficult to do because all of them are three to four years old. It is true that there possibly could have been individual parts that may have been out of specification for a set. And it is possible that although I bought one of the three from a different supplier, they could have been manufactured in a non-spec batch. Anyway, it doesn’t seem as though JBL intentionally was selling out-of-spec products or changing parts without notification. performance is smooth so reflections come back to listeners with natural tonal balance.

additional commentS by david a. rich
The specification sheet for the LSR6325P-1 on the JBL Pro website is very detailed. Tom could not transcribe all the information on the drivers and crossovers in this review. Many measurements for distortion and frequency response are also presented in the LSR6325P-1 datasheet including the so-called Spin-o-rama frequency response data set. They call it Spin-o-rama because 70 measurements are made in 10° intervals around the vertical and horizontal orbits of the speaker. Each of the six curves of the Spin-o-rama frequency response data set are produced from different averages of a select number of the 70 measurements. This data set is Harman Labs enhancement of the work done by Floyd Toole at the Canadian NRC. A detailed understanding of the Spino-rama frequency response measurement and how they guided the design of the LSR6325P can be found in many AES papers by Dr. Toole and other members of Harman Labs as well as Dr. Toole’s book, Sound Reproduction (www.amazon.com). You can get the information for free by searching for Dr. Toole’s online paper “Making a good loudspeaker—Imaging, space and great sound in rooms” (www.infinitysystems.com/home/ technology/whitepapers/inf-rooms_2.pdf). JBL Pro calls the design process Linear Spatial Reference technology. Unfortunately, none of the Spin-o-rama or distortion graphs are presented in the datasheets for the Harman consumer products. Some other companies producing professional studio monitors also provide significant information on the design process they use in addition to providing a significant amount of measurements that are absent in the consumer world. A spec sheet for a Genelec product is a good example (www.genelec.com).

Subjective Summary
Listening to these speakers individually or as a stereo pair or as components in a surround system is simply natural. Highs are extended, mids are neutral, and the limited low-end sounds okay by itself but needs a subwoofer for best sound. And, best of all, the off-axis

FIGURE 4: Second set LSR6325p taken three years apart. Again, no significant wear is seen. Notice the 19kHz tweeter peak.

manufacturer’S comment:

We are looking into the tweeter anomaly in some of the samples of the LSR6325p tested. rr
