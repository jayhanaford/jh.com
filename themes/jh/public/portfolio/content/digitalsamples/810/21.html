	<div id="content"  class="content">Since 2005, the “Technology Stage” has offered a range of lectures as an integral part of the show, including a variety of lectures and forum discussions ranging from the basics of mains- and power supplies and the ins and outs of (a)symmetrical connections to high-end digital room correction. In particular, the full-hour presentation of Mr. Hans M. Strassner about mains supplies, mains filtering, and power supplies did not leave a seat free (Photo 6). It was remarkable to see that everything he said was soaked up by a very attentive audience. I hope that this part of the show will be extended, because there is a great need for this type of factual technical audio knowledge.

One of those areas where knowledge and understanding will lead to an improved listening experience is acoustics. While bad room acoustics are often to blame for a less than optimal listening experience, the solutions are often sought in new equipment, cables, or recordings. One of the companies offering a wide range of products to solve acoustic problems is Vicoustic (www.vicoustic.com). From bass traps and absorption panels to diffusion panels and accessories, they have it. So next time you are not satisfied with the overall audio quality of your audio system, you might consider experimenting with the room acoustics. At a show like this you always find the products and displays that bring a smile to your face, like the Analog Domain Audio Apollo amplifier (analogdomain.eu). Rated 4000W in 8Ω/or 8000W into 4Ω, this is truly a monster with a triple switched class H output stage. Or a product such as the “Magic Flute” loudspeaker from Swspeakers, which looks like a jet engine display that ran away from an air show (Photo 7, www.swspeakers.com). You often see amplifiers displayed with open hoods. Some companies go to great lengths to show their product’s innards. A product such as the Ayre KX-R preamp is definitely a beauty (Photo 8, www.ayre.com). But what to think of a Mark Levinson amplifier taken apart so completely that it looks as though they’re selling the components on the DIY market (Photo 9, www.marklevinson.com)? If you truly are in audio, then you need to look at the products of Silent Wire (Photo 10, www.silent-wire.de). There are many discussions regarding cables and how
