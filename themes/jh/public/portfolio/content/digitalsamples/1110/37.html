It also teaches you very quickly the ins and outs of doing business and how to safeguard your own interests. JD: Did you go into technical design work when you left school? VDH: I studied at Delft Technical University, and when I finished my studies I went into particle research at the university’s particle accelerator, but at a certain point the research went into an offensive direction that I couldn’t support, so I quit. After a stint in teaching, I decided to move on to the next station, and founded my own company to sell the phono stylus I had just developed. That stylus success, of course, opened up the possibility to do a lot of other things I am interested in, one of which is everything involving cabling. After that, I never looked back and have been involved in music, in the broadest sense, ever since. Music and sound was my motivator, but I never looked at it in isolation; I always have been interested in issues surrounding audio. JD: What was so special about that stylus tip? VDH: It has a side rounding radius that is constant, no matter how low or high it rides in the groove. The result is that the high-frequency tracing does not depend on amplitude, which is not the case with a lot of other tip shapes (Fig. 1). Now, patenting this tip was pretty hard. I had to travel to the States several times, and made presentations of slides I made from tip pictures taken through my father’s microscope. But eventually I was able to convince the patent people that my tip was new and much better, and my US patent was

granted. At that point people started to notice me because the quality improvement of that tip was so evident. At that time Philips was already working on the CD, so they weren’t excited about the prospect of this new tip. I got a visit from a gentleman from the famous company who invited me to company headquarters in Eindhoven. They ushered me into a fancy restaurant and proceeded to feed me lots of very good port wine. Then they offered me 25,000 Dutch guilders (about 12,000 euro) if I would stop all my activities with these tips. I wasn’t impressed by that figure and told them so, and that was the end of it. JD: Were you also building cartridges at that time? VDH: No, that came later. I started designing (and repairing—a great source of knowledge!) cartridges around 1987, just before the CD appeared. That was hard! Imagine winding coils with wire one-quarter the thickness of a human hair, or even less. After I taught myself to do it, I demo’d it to a group of audio journalists looking over my shoulder. Then it went fast: I started to design cartridges for Benz in Switzerland; I designed the Goldring Elite, and maybe six others. Goldring promised me one British pound per cartridge, but when the time came to pay they said they re-

ally didn’t have the money. That’s when I decided to build and sell my cartridges myself, and I’ve sold many thousands, worldwide. JD: What’s the main activity of the van den Hul Company these days? VDH: Of course, we’re still in the cartridge business. One interesting niche is providing cartridges for music companies that wish to reissue music for which they no longer have the master tapes! We then provide them with the high-quality means to regenerate the master, so to speak, from a well-preserved record. The bulk of the company business these days is cables and cabling systems, but my own focus is still shifting. One of the things I’ve done recently is to develop some programs to help companies and shops that aren’t doing so well. I’ve done a lot of work on that in the Ukraine, and apparently successfully, because I am at present an honorary citizen of the capital, Kiev. So I really enjoy going off on tangents not directly related to audio, which will always remain a strong interest and hobby! JD: That golden key on your prize shelf is the key to the city of Kiev? VDH: Yes. There are some other interesting items (Photo 1). You see this “White House” baseball cap? Worn by President George W. Bush on one of
