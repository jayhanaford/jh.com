Ground Loop Basics
Running an MP3 player through your car stereo can teach you a lot about ground loops.

A

udio enthusiasts commonly encounter “ground loops,” but often have difficulty recognizing and eliminating them. This article uses a realworld example (charging an MP3 player while it’s playing through a car stereo) to provide an intuitive understanding of conducted ground loops and how to eliminate the noise they cause.

NOISY MUSIC

To experience this ground loop, play music from an MP3 player through your car stereo’s auxiliary, or AUX, jack (usually a 3.5mm stereo jack). The sound should be clear and clean. Pause the music, and turn the car stereo volume all the way up. The speakers should be silent. Immediately turn the volume back down. Do not play music with the volume all the way up; you could blow out your car’s speakers. With the volume back down at normal levels, plug the MP3 player into a charger powered by the car’s 12V DC accessory power jack (the “cigarette lighter” jack). An annoying, pulsating, and hissing sound should be superimposed on the music coming from the car’s speakers. To hear this noise very clearly, pause the music, turn the car stereo volume all the way up, and then plug and unplug the charger

from the accessory jack. The noise appears only when the MP3 player is charging. Again, immediately turn the volume back down before doing anything else. Figure 1 shows plots of 1kHz sine waves generated by an MP3 player and measured at the power amplifier output. The top curve shows the nominal audio signal, and the lower plot shows the effect of ground loop noise when the MP3 player is charging.

This pulsating hiss is the result of charging currents flowing back to the car battery through the MP3 player’s audio cable—a “ground loop.” It doesn’t matter whether the charger is a switching converter or a linear regulator, because the noise is caused by the battery-charging circuitry in the MP3 player itself. The noise texture will change as the charging circuit changes modes (the noise is worse when the MP3 player’s battery is low).
