	<div id="content"  class="content">About voltage clipping and output transistor damages For a given nominal impedance level, current-drive asks somewhat more voltage but correspondingly less current than voltage drive. To compensate this shift, it may be appropriate to use 4W drivers. As for damages to the output transistors, I have numerous times forgotten to connect the load when playing or testing current amps, and never had such faults. Proper protection diodes to the supply rails are usually sufficient. In current-drive, one doesn’t need to beware of shorting the speaker leads either; and driver protection also becomes easier and better controlled because it is possible to use power transistors as the protective devices. The pulse tests (Im)pulse responses, in general, do not render useful information as to the qualities of the driving modes since the impulse response of any linear system contains only the same information as the frequency response but in a different form. As I have tried to emphasize in the book, the frequency behavior and time behavior are not separate things but one and the same thing only viewed differently. Therefore, if we have a current-drive speaker that exhibits the same frequency response (including phase) as some voltage drive speaker, their time responses (for a given input) are also inevitably identical, as dictated by the Fourier theorem; so in this regard one cannot be better than the other. When interpreting oscillations, you should always be mindful of what frequencies are dealt with. In Fig. 7 in the review (KLH pulse), you can observe periodicity of some 0.5ms, which corresponds to the 2kHz response peak appearing in Figs. 5 and 6. In Fig. 8 (SEAS pulse), there occurs quite pure 5kHz oscillation that stems directly from the sharp cone break-up peak seen in Figs. 3 and 4. In Fig. 9, the oscillations are above 10kHz, the corresponding response peak being left beyond the scale of Figs. 1 and 2. In either case, the oscillations reflect the high-frequency prominences occurring in the respective frequency plots but are unrelated to the Q-value or any bass damping properties of the systems. The step tests The same principles also hold for the

step responses shown in Figs. 10 and 11; the time domain properties are a consequence of the frequency domain properties rather than the technology used. In Fig. 11, you can discern a period of about 30ms, which is attributable to the 35Hz peaking found in Fig. 4. The current-drive amp cannot be responsible for any damping here; it is the driver-enclosure mechanical resistance that retards the movement but is only somewhat insufficient. The acoustic phase In a 2nd-order high-pass system, like a woofer in a sealed enclosure, the phase shift approaches zero at high frequencies, rises to 90° at the resonant frequency, and levels off to 180° below the resonance. In Fig. 12, the excess phase lead in addition to that must be due to the mike’s phase response, when approaching or passing its lower frequency limit. Anyway, the result also shows that low frequencies are reproduced in advance of higher ones, at least in terms of phase, and not after as is commonly thought. The bass distortion Concerning Fig. 13, lowering the mechanical Q is indeed key to control this

type of distortion; but it is also noteworthy that the driver was mounted in a very large enclosure (I was told 95 ltr) and without proper stuffing, so the system is operating at the mercy of the driver’s own nonlinear spring force and damping force. Both of these can be linearized considerably by a small enough cabinet and effective use of damping material (and driver optimization). As a general note, to get a proper picture of the subject, we must be able to widen the perspective outside the bass response, that can always be tailored according to one’s preferences, and look squarely at the manifold interference and nonlinearity mechanisms, that reach even to the 10 percent range and corrupt the flow of current in the middle and treble regions. There has not happened any major development in loudspeaker technology in our lifetimes, and even the numbers of enthusiasts have undergone a downward trend. Wouldn’t it be a high time to do something about this; the more so when there are very definite and concrete benefits to be gained!
