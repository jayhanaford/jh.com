	<div id="content"  class="content">company’s investment bank, Goldman Sachs, to complete the auction this summer before the European debt crisis can further impact the sale price. Day hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for the CE chain, the newspaper said, and he and other senior RadioShack executives are supposedly giving presentations to bidders. IBM (www.ibm.com) released its first-ever forecast for CE sales, stating sales for the next three months should increase 4% compared with 2009. IBM expects sales of CE products in the US in June, July, and August to total $24.6 billion. The data is compiled by Dr. Michael Haydock, who is a partner in IBM’s Global Business Services and worldwide practice leader, customer analytics-business analytics and optimization. Haydock leads the business analytics and consulting team, which uses data supplied by the US Census Bureau. The forecast is based on data supplied to the government by 43,000 retailers across the country that sell CE and major appliance products. Haydock takes the data and produces an index from which his forecast is derived. While the report does not give data on how specific product categories will perform, it generally covers TVs, cell phones, personal computers and tablet computers, radios and stereos, refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens, and other devices. Businesses can use the report to make general assumptions about how future sales will go and can make the appropriate decisions on staffing, advertising, and inventory. Going forward, the report will be issued monthly to the public. Haydock’s division also generates reports for specific paying customers.

Consumer confidence in the overall economy remained relatively unchanged in May, while confidence in technology showed a slight drop, according to the latest data released from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA, www. ce.org) and CNET (www.cnet.com).  The CEA-CNET Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) rose one-tenth of a point to 164.2 in May. The ICE, which measures consumer expectations about the broader economy, is down over ten points from this time last year. Consumer confidence in technology showed a slight decrease this month. The CEACNET Index of Consumer Technology Expectations (ICTE) fell eight tenths of a point to 71.5. The ICTE, which measures consumer expectations about technology spending, reached its lowest level since its all-time low in March 2009. The ICTE is down nearly ten points from last year. The CEA-CNET Indexes are composed of the ICE and ICTE, both of which are updated on a monthly basis through consumer surveys.  New data is released on the fourth Tuesday of each month. CEA and CNET have been tracking index data since January 2007. To find current and past indexes, charts, methodology, and future release dates, log on to CEACNETindexes.org.
