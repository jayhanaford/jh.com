box simulations, both sealed. For the first closed box simulation I used a 169 in3 enclosure with 50% fiberglass fill material, and for the second sealed box, a 100 in3 enclosure also with 50% fiberglass fill material. Figure 17 displays the results for the HR124B8-10L in the two sealed boxes at 2.83V and at a voltage level high enough to increase cone excursion to Xmax + 15% (2.3mm). This resulted in a F3 = 104Hz with a box/driver Qtc of 0.69 for the 169 in3 sealed enclosure and a -3dB = 115Hz and a box/driver Qtc of 0.80 for the 100 in3 simulation. Increasing the voltage input to the two box simulations until the maximum linear cone excursion was reached resulted in 96dB at 9V for the first sealed enclosure simulation and 98dB with an 11V input level for the smaller sealed box (see Figs. 18 and 19 for the 2.83V group delay curves and the 9/11V excursion curves). Obviously, this is a midrange driver that is expected to have a high-pass filter placed somewhere between probably 400Hz-800Hz, so these output numbers would be considerably higher, but for a 4.5″ driver with only 2mm Xmax, not so bad. Klippel analysis for the Airborne woofer produced the Bl(X), Kms(X), and Bl and Kms symmetry range plots given in Figs. 20-23. The Bl(X) curve for the HR124 (Fig. 20) is very symmetrical and narrow as you would expect for a short Xmax driver. This is accompanied by a small amount of coil-in offset of 0.08mm at rest (see the Bl symmetry range plot in Fig. 21) that remains fairly constant throughout the operating range of the midrange. Figures 22 and 23 give the Kms(X) and Kms symmetry range curves. The Kms(X) curve has good symmetry, but also with a small 0.08mm rearward coil-in offset that transitions to a likewise trivial coil-out offset above 0.75mm of excursion. Displacement limiting numbers calculated by the Klippel analyzer for the Airborne woofer were XBl at 82% Bl = 0.6mm and for XC at 75% Cms minimum was 0.6mm, which means that for this 4.5″ midrange, both factors were equal contributors to the 10% distortion level provided this driver were operating full-range, but being a midrange using a high-pass filter, this data is only for reference. Figure 24 gives the inductance curves Le(X) for the Airborne FR148 which shows the typical increase in inductance as the voice coil covers more of the pole piece. Following the Klippel testing, I mounted the HR124 midrange driver in an enclosure which had a 12″ × 5″ baffle that was filled with foam damping material and then measured the driver both on- and off-axis from 300Hz to 20kHz frequency response at 2.83V/1m using a 100 point gated sine wave sweep. Figure 25 depicts the onaxis response displaying a very smooth rising response to about 8.2kHz, followed by an out-of-phase dip in the response. Figure 26 gives the on- and off-axis frequency response at 0, 15, 30, and 45°. -3dB at 30° with respect to the on-axis curve occurs at 3.8kHz, so a 4kHz crossover frequency would be appropriate for this driver. And finally, Fig. 27 gives the two-sample SPL comparisons for the 4.5″ Airborne midrange driver, showing a good match with some minor less than 1dB variations.
