	<div id="content"  class="content">JD: The electromagnetic view led you to carbon interlinks? VDH: It’s hard to say how creativity works, but I remember wondering why everything always had to be from metal for low resistance, and the importance of low resistance. I started to think about designing a non-metallic cable and ended up with carbon. Not superlow resistance, but with a perfect lattice structure, much better than any metal cable could reach. No impurities, no structural defects. So, don’t look only at conduction. There’s a well-known company here in Holland, Siltech (www.siltechcables. com), who advertised the fact that they dope their silver cables with 5% gold. On the face of it you might think it helps conduction. But a gold molecule has a much larger structure than a silver molecule. So by gold doping you introduce a lot of irregularities in that cable! Many of our cables are a combination of metal core with a carbon mantle. The carbon improves the conduction when there are small defects in the metal. It gives a better chemical protection and absorbs EMI better. Here at our laboratories I have run a separate spur to the entry panel with our own hi-end mains cable. Now, you can say, how can it make a difference when I have 40 miles of ordinary wire ahead of it to the substation? But what that special cable does is filter out a lot of HF interference that is generated locally in our building from the myriad computers, test equipment, cell phones, and other gear. Filtering your mains signal and avoiding interference contribute to cleaner sound. JD: You also use your own proprietary insulation on your cables. VDH: Yes, I use halogen-free material in the insulation and jackets, without softening products, which we developed ourselves. That was a decision I
E10

made in 1990, to go away from PVC and make our own materials. JD: Does that influence the performance of the cable as a conductor of electrical signals? VDH: Yes, it does. Chemicals are always restless, always on the move. PVC migrates all over the place and eventually damages the metal structures of the conductor. Soft-makers, which you need to keep PVC supple and soft, are quite aggressive in this respect. And over time they evaporate, making the PVC shell hard. So, when you then bend or flex the cable, something has to give and very often it internally damages the conductor. Cables are needed to transport the music, but they must do that as cleanly as possible; the emotion is in the music and not in the cable! JD: So coming back to the carbon cable, if I would measure it, would it have a rather high resistance? VDH: About 28Ω for a meter. But that’s of no consequence for an audio interconnect. Anyway, look at that [carbon] cable as a series of circular molecules of carbon and hydrogen where you remove a hydrogen atom from one position. Figure 2 gives an impression of such a molecule. The position where the hydrogen atom is removed (light

gray) becomes the position where the molecules latch together, and you get a perfectly regular structure. The difficulty in 1990 was how to manufacture such a cable. JD: Is there a clear relation between cable performance and price? VDH: Sometimes people question the pricing of our cables, but there’s always a good reason something costs more than a comparable product. For example, some cable manufacturers use the equivalent of a pair of drills, at opposite ends, to twist their cables. That is the best way to ruin the cable! It may still look good, but sound-wise it will be a disaster. I consider carbon fiber the best electrical connection you can have: very reliable, not chemically active, and extremely stable both electrically and mechanically and with a perfect internal structure for signal transfer. JD: Dr. van den Hul, what, then, are your personal interests these days? VDH: Actually, lots of my time goes to two areas. One area is a kind of fallout of my carbon cables. I really like these fibers; some time ago I started a new company for developing all kinds of high-tech fibers. Not just carbon fibers, but also aramide-type fibers and even fibers made from basalt rock material! [Points to a model of an Antonov 225 giant transport plane on his desk.] See that plane? Can you imagine the stress on whatever keeps those two wing halves together on top of the fuselage? When the plane taxis, and the wing tanks are full of kerosene, our carbon fibers keep them from falling off! No kidding! There’s even a satellite in orbit that has a VDH carbon frame. Once people find out the advantages of that material, it really takes off. Selected HP and ASUS laptops have our car-
