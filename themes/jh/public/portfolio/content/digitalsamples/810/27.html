The Clinton facility was previously owned by International Jenson Incorporated and manufactures molded paper cones and some poly cones. In 2002 NuWay opened their newest plant in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. NuWay currently has about 150 customers and is one of the largest soft-good component manufacturers in North America. NuWay is still owned and operated by the Smith family, with Claude formerly functioning as CEO, Dennis Smith as President and Jim Smith as Vice-President. Nuway currently has approximately 320 full-time employees combined in all facilities, running two shifts.

Dr. Patronis is most assuredly alive and well and still Professor Emeritus in the Physics Department of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Sorry, Gene!

Gross will launch the new company, GoldenEar Technology (loudspeaker7@aol.com),
