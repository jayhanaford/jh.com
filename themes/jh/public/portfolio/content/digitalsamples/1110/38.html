	<div id="content"  class="content">his jogging runs; I managed to hold on to it during my White House visit. Another dear memorabilia, but for other reasons of course, is a pair of bricks from the Dachau Nazi concentration camp, where my father was held. I had to put a lot of effort in getting my hands on that Concorde model (Photo 2), but it was worth it. I think this is one of the most beautiful planes ever made. A further development of the equally beautiful British Vulcan bomber. JD: Getting back to audio, I notice you listen to classical music while at work. VDH: Of course, never forget to listen to the music! That’s why I spend at least a week every year in Vienna. I go to the Staatsoper or to the Musikverein. Now, the Musikverein is an inter-

esting venue that is relatively narrow and long. Yet you hear the detailed placement and sound stage of the orchestra, whatever seat you are in. I can easily identify the Wiener Philharmonic, the Wiener Symphonic, and the Berliner Symphonic. The Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra is more difficult because they often have different guest conductors who change some of the characteristic sounds. The Berliner Symphonic, for instance, has a very constant and stable recording technique and equipment which makes their characteristic sound easily recognizable. It’s also simply miked—just two or three, with possibly a few in the back of the venue to capture the acoustics. Good sound engineering means that the orchestra and venue are clearly

recognizable in the end product. But it puts a lot of responsibility on the recording engineer. He needs to have a first-class pair of ears and needs to be able to listen “through” the performance—with the entire attendant recording stress—to know how it will sound at the end of the process. He needs to have a strong image in his brain of how he wants it to be. That’s one of the strengths Decca had: Their SXL series is very high quality and very consistent, clearly recorded with the same equipment by the same people for the whole series. I don’t think it has ever again been done so well, although EMI often came close. Good sound recording is not easy and we should recognize the incredible jobs some of these people do for us.
