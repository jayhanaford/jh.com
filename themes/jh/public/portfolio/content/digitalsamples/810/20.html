	<div id="content"  class="content">The focus of the Kilimanjaro-Series speakers is mainly on vintage equipment. But because prices for products like that are becoming more and more acceptable (I did not say cheap), they become more and more open to experimentation. By changing the current through the field coil, you can change the T/S parameters. Of course, they are also ideally suited for listening to music (www.kilimanjaro-series.com). A different fundamental approach to loudspeaker chassis design was taken by Audio Consequence. Their 190mm inverted coaxial loudspeaker chassis (Photo 4), which will be available in the third quarter of this year, is not only remarkable in appearance, but also offers a solution to the design problem in coaxial chassis where an ideal position of the tweeter is less ideal for the woofer and vice versa. This loudspeaker chassis is usable in a full-range system (20-25 ltr) going down to 35Hz. Even 20Hz is possible with a limitation regarding output power. And even an Xlin of ±6mm and an Xmax of ±11mm eventually comes to an end. Support of a woofer up to 200Hz can be a welcome addition (www.audioconsequence.de).

For the DIYer, the Ground Sound booth offered a large range of modules for active amplification: digital crossover modules, power amplifier modules from 100-1500W, power supply modules, and transformers (Photo 5). With their Xoverwizard II software, they demonstrated the ease in making a decent setup for an active version of the Focal Esprit loudspeaker (www.groundsound.com).
