Infinity Classia C336 Floor Standing Speaker
Infinity Division Harman International Corporate Headquarters 400 Atlantic Street Stamford, CT 06901 www.infinitysystems.com 800-553-3332 PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS •	Low-frequency	driver	Triple	6½″	 CMMD	cone,	stamped	basket •	Midrange	driver	4″	CMMD	cone,	 stamped	basket •	High-frequency	driver	1″	CMMD	dome •	Crossover	frequencies	500Hz,	 2800Hz;	24dB/octave	acoustic •	Dimensions	48½″	H	×	8½″	W	×	 10½″	D •	Finish	of	real	wood	section	Cherry	or	 high-gloss-black •	Weight	56.1	lb •	Price	$899	each Infinity	 has	 been	 offering	 popularly	 priced	 speakers	 designed	 to	 the	 Canadian	 National	 Research	 Council	 standard	 shortly	 after	 Dr.	 Floyd	 Toole	 decamped	 with	 some	 of	 his	 graduate	 students	to	Harman	International.	Soon	 many	speakers	emerged	from	their	laboratory,	 including	 some	 in	 plain	 boxes	 in	 good-looking	 vinyl	 wood	 enclosures	 to	be	sold	at	very	competitive	prices	in	 large-chain	 electronic	 stores	 under	 the	 Infinity	brand. Starting	 with	 the	 IL	 series	 in	 2001	 and	 evolving	 through	 the	 Alpha	 and	 Beta	 designs,	 Infinity	 had	 many	 bestbuy	products.	I	participated	in	a	review	 of	the	$1000	IL	40	with	Peter	Aczel	in	 my	Audio Critic	days,	and	they	were	a	 breakthrough	in	terms	of	performance	 for	the	price.	Peter	wrote	of	the	IL	40:	 “Only	 when	 I	 switched	 to	 my	 reference	was	I	reminded	that	there	exists	 E12 a	further	degree	of	refinement	in	loudspeakers.” I	 reviewed	 the	 Beta	 40	 for	 Sensible Sound	in	2005.	The	Beta	40	was	actually	 at	 a	 lower	 price	 of	 $800	 per	 pair	 and	was	still	a	clear	best	bang	for	the	 buck.	 I	 did	 a	 deep	 dive	 in	 my	 review	 (Dec./Jan.	 2006	 Issue	 108)	 on	 the	 design	 approach	 of	 Dr.	 Toole	 and	 his	 team.	 You	 can	 find	 the	 review	 online	 without	the	figures	at: www.thefreelibrary.com/Infinity+Beta	 +40+loudspeakers.-a0139430354. Infinity,	 of	 course,	 had	 more	 expensive	 speakers	 (the	 Prelude	 line)	 that	 had	been	designed	to	be	the	reference.	 Subsequently,	 Infinity	 introduced	 the	 Kappa	 line	 with	 its	 more	 stylish	 wood	 cabinet	that	split	the	difference	in	price.	 These	more	expensive	lines	slowly	faded	 away,	 leaving	 the	 Beta	 as	 the	 topdog	floor-stander.

FEATURES The	Classia	C336	replaces	the	Beta	in	 the	US,	but	has	some	relation	to	Kappa	 with	 the	 C336	 curved,	 real	 wood,	 top	 and	 front	 bottom	 sections	 attached	 to a	unique	ultra	thin	(8.5″)	wood	cabinet	 (Photo 1).	The	wood	pieces	are	made	 of	 layers	 of	 plywood	 laminated	 with	 a	 wood	veneer.	Multiple	layers	of	polyurethane	are	then	applied	to	the	wood	for	 a	 high-quality	 look.	 The	 cabinet	 tapers	 from	front	to	rear.	At	10.5″,	front	to	rear	 the	cabinet	is	not	very	deep.	The	sides	 of	 the	 speaker	 are	 clad	 in	 black	 vinyl	 and	have	vertical	grooves	spaced	about	 an	inch	apart.	 The	 grille	 frame	 is	 plastic	 with	 the	 older	 plastic	 plugs	 that	 fit	 into	 plastic	 holes	to	hold	it	in	place,	rather	than	the	 more	modern	magnets.	Metal	strips	are	 at	 the	 top	 and	 bottom	 of	 the	 grille	 to	 enhance	 the	 high-tech	 look.	 The	 grille
