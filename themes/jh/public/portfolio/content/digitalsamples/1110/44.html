third octave averaging. The vertical axis spans only 15dB again making response variations easier to see. Most of the frequency response is within ±1.5dB even with the 0.05 octave averaging. Room effect may still be present until 400Hz, since I could not raise the heavy speaker off the floor to reduce reflections that corrupt the quasi-anechoic measurements. The dip at 600Hz is real and is discussed later. The 15kHz tweeter resonance is not a defect since it shows up on Infinity-generated graphs I was supplied. I wanted more clarification on the resonance, but this was the one issue for which I could not get sufficient color from Harman. Figure 2 shows the horizontal radiation of the C336. I measured it on the tweeter axis, which gives the flattest response, but this is not very critical for the C336 as highlighted in the vertical radiation patterns. Figure 2 runs from 0 to 75° off-axis in 15° steps at 1m back. Smoothing was increased to 0.15 octaves to make the graph less noisy. Figure 2 illustrates the hallmark of an Infinity design: The amplitude declines monotonically as the horizontal angle increases. This ensures that the room reflections in the horizontal direction (off the walls) are similar to the on-axis response. A typical speaker shows a rise in amplitude in the off-axis curves back to the flat response above the crossover frequency between the midrange and tweeter, as explained by the reduced off-axis response of the typical 4-6″ midrange at the crossover frequency being brought back to base line as the tweeter becomes active. The tweeter is normally not directional at the crossover frequency. A special waveguide on the Infinity tweeter matches the dispersion characteristic of the midrange to the tweeter at the crossover. Only between 2–2.5kHz is there non–monotonic behavior in the off-axis curves in the horizontal direction. Dr. Toole has commented about the Harman design approach and the ef-
