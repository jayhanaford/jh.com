The voice coil is positioned as a spiral around the periphery of the dome shape on the flat portion of the diaphragm. It is preferably attached by adhesive, etching, or silk-screen to the bottom surface of the flatter portion of the diaphragm surrounding the dome. The dome-shaped diaphragm has its embedded voice coil disposed on top of a permanent magnet and secured to the speaker frame. The diaphragm, voice coil, magnet, and frame are all mounted concentrically with an opening through the center of the frame and the magnet to provide ventilation for dissipating heat generated by the voice coil and for releasing back pressure built up by the diaphragm’s excursion. Similar spiral coils in co-planer relationships with the magnetic circuit have been utilized in prior art tweeters of the 1970s, but were not developed as full range devices. The voice coil suspended in a parallel fashion over the magnetic circuit may make for a shallower package, and without as-tight spacing, tolerance requirements may make for an easier build, but the claim for greater spacing between the voice coil when used with this type of architecture will inherently be limited in terms of competitive efficiency. If that tradeoff is acceptable, then the structure may be useful in micro devices as intended. VC

Industry Watch

By Vance Dickason
t is with deepest regrets that Voice Coil announces the passing of Claude D. Smith, the founder of Nuway Speaker Products. Mr. Smith’s speaker career began over 53 years ago when he founded NuWay Speaker Products (www.nuway-speaker.com). The original plant was located in Franklin Park, Ill., a suburb on the northwest side of Chicago.  NuWay’s original line of business—and still the mainstay of the business today—was making spiders/dampers for the loudspeaker industry. During the first 20 years, the company experienced slow but steady growth. By the mid-70s NuWay began to see a bigger increase in sales due to the startup of seamed cone production, and in 1976 opened a second facility in Antioch, Ill., about 45 miles north of the original Franklin Park plant. The location in Antioch is now corporate headquarters. In the early 1980s Nuway built an addition in Antioch to house the molded cone department and by 1985 were in production of the company’s first molded paper cones.  Nuway’s growth continued at a steady (although considerably faster) pace and in 1995 the company built its newest facility in Antioch, right across the street from the original Antioch plant.  This plant now houses the spider and dust cap production as well as tooling, maintenance,
