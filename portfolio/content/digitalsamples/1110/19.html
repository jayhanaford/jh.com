the Lm60 is noisy at lower levels or just showing low-level crossover distortion. Figure 2 shows the distortion versus frequency. I ran two different levels for the three simple, similar kits, excluding the two Vellemans. As you can see, the Lm60 at 50mV (A, at .07%) is straight. I assume that is because the noise is dominant. At 500mV it had the lowest measured distortion by almost literally a hair! So I would not use this amplifier with high sensitivity loudspeakers. The gainclone at 50mV also showed the effect of noise but less than the Lm60. At 250mV (it clips with less input than the Lm60) it had similar very good results. The other three kits showed similar performance except the high frequency distortion was less for the kitsrus K88, probably due to the output network RC network loading. There was one very happy discovery in the process of testing these small amplifier kits. I decided to pick up a small bookshelf loudspeaker kit typical of what could be used with these kits. I was shopping for some other needed parts at Madisound (www.madisound.com) and asked their recommendations on a small loudspeaker kit of high quality and typical of a first project. They were enthusiastic about the Zaph Audio SR71, but were out of the Madisound MD14 enclosure’s parts. I ordered the kit with upgraded capacitors but no enclosure, because I have a reasonably complete woodshop. The kit arrived with preassembled crossovers on a standard PC card. You have the choice of biamplifying these speakers, but I used jumpers to couple the inputs, because I wanted to evaluate amplifiers.

COMPANION BOXES

I looked at my wood stock and found it lacking in 1″ thick stock to make nice boxes. When I went shopping for a few small sticks, there was nothing outstanding at the local specialty shop. At the Home Depot I came across some nicelooking thick pieces of wood being sold as premade stair treads! Glued up from smaller pieces and covered with veneer, these were available in pine or oak, and just the right size for the boxes needed. I chose the pine, which I could easily stain and cost less money. I had no noteworthy problems building the boxes from the plans provided with the kits. Lurking in my paint cabinet was a very old can of mahogany oil stain. That and a few coats of lacquer from a spray can finished the boxes. The recommended burn in of 100 hours or so was just as easy. I hooked them up to the shop’s solar-powered radio (I am frugal) and let them play for a month or so. Immediately noticeable was the amazing amount of low-frequency energy coming out of such a small box. A small loudspeaker I can truly recommend for beginner to advanced. I strongly suggest going with the MD-14 enclosure. I spent too much time just looking for the wood for such a simple project.

So if you want a really simple upgrade to your computer or personal music player, try any of the small amplifiers on a decent loudspeaker, but if you want stunning results, try one of the more powerful kits on a top-notch small speaker. aX
