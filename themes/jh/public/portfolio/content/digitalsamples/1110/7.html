	<div id="content"  class="content">of 20-40 would work just fine. 6SN7 seemed to fit the bill for this project, but because I have built several amps with the 6SN7, I decided to use another tube. I dug into my private stock and found an ECC40 that I had bought from a local shop in Thailand ten years ago, but I couldn’t do anything with because there was no socket available. That applied to other rimlock tubes such as the ECC40, EL41, and EF40 sold by online retailers but without their sockets. Until recently, I noticed the new production of rimlock socket available on eBay as well as from some online tube retailers. I guess the demand for using these tubes has increased lately. So, using ECC40 is now possible for DIYers. Philips is perhaps the most common brand of ECC40, but I see almost every European brand, such as Valvo, Siemens, Telefunken, and Mullard, for the ECC40.

THE CIRCUIT

Figure 1 shows the amplifier sche-

matic and power supply. The design is quite simple. The IXYS 10M45 current regulator IC is used as a constantcurrent source (CCS) load for ECC40. You may use Supertex DN2540 as the CCS. I chose 200V, 6mA as the bias point of the ECC40. The voltage bias at the cathode of ECC40 was 4V, which is more than enough for driving small power tubes such as 7591. I recommend adjusting the 10M45 before you put it to the real circuit. You can use the schematic in Fig. 2 for the adjustment. The power amp’s power supply is used for the adjustment process. A stopper resistor on the 10M45’s anode is recommended to prevent oscillation. Before turning on the power supply, adjust pot 5kW to maximum value for the lowest current. Then turn on the power supply and check out the voltage reading across the 30K resistor. Adjust the 5kW pot until you read 180V across the resistor. That means you adjust the 10M45 to pass the current of 6mA. In the original 7591 datasheet, 1MΩ resistor was the maximum value of
