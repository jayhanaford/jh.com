This noise voltage appears as hiss in the output sound.

current flowing through impedance produces voltage (V = IR). This noise voltage (Fig. 6) is generated between the car’s power amplifier signal reference (the car’s frame) and the MP3 player’s signal reference (within the MP3 player). From the car amplifier’s point of view, this noise voltage adds to the audio signal voltage. You can show this clearly by simplifying Fig. 6 in steps (Figs. 7-9). Figures 7-9 are successive simplifications of Fig. 6. They show how, from the car stereo’s point of view, the ground loop noise is added to the audio signal. Figure 7 shows that the noise voltage moves the MP3 player’s voltage reference up and down relative to the car stereo’s signal reference. From the car stereo’s point of view (looking back into the signal coming from the MP3 player), it sees the MP3 player’s signal moving up and down relative to its own signal reference (the car stereo’s signal reference). The car amplifier cannot tell

what portion of the MP3 player’s output is signal, and which part is noise. It sends both the audio signal and ground loop noise to the speakers. This type of audio system is called “single-ended.” High-end audio uses differential drivers that avoid this problem by sending both the signal (with its embedded noise) and the local reference (with the same embedded noise) to a differential receiver that subtracts the two voltages, recovering only the signal. If you assume the MP3 player’s output amplifier is just a buffer—that all it does is lower the output impedance of the signal it’s driving—you can remove it from your schematic (Fig. 8). To make the picture even clearer, you simply slide the noise voltage to the left along the signal path so that it stacks up with the audio signal (Fig. 9). This clearly shows how, from the car stereo’s point of view, the ground loop noise is added to the audio signal. This, then, is the problem: Charging

currents flowing back to the car battery through the audio cable return conductor superimpose a pulsating, hissing noise on the desired audio signal.
SOLUTIONS

An easy way to show that you understand the problem is to unplug the charger from the car’s 12V power jack, and power the charger from a “standalone” 9V battery. The MP3 player will still charge, but the hissing noise will disappear. This is because charging currents can only flow back to the 9V battery through the charger cable—there are no other return paths (no “ground loops”) back to the 9V battery (Fig. 10). If you have a 110V outlet in your car, you can also eliminate the ground loop by using a transformer-isolated charger (Fig. 11). Although “standalone” charging power sources can solve the problem, another solution is to prevent any charging current from flowing back through the audio cable return conductor.

FIGURE 8: Removing the MP3 player amplifier from the schematic shows how the ground loop noise is added to the MP3’s audio signal.

FIGURE 9: All I’ve done in going from Fig. 8 to Fig. 9 is slide the noise voltage to the left along the signal path to show how it stacks up with the audio signal. The car stereo amplifier sends both signal and noise to the speakers.
