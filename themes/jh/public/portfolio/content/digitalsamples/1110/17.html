When used with a higher supply voltage, it also has a bit more oomph. This kit is more complete in that screw terminals are provided for the input and output. The downside is that they provide only one input ground terminal and just one for the outputs. The Vellemans used a TDA2003 amplifier chip for the K4001 and a TDA2616 for the K4003; this amplifier used a TDA2009. I gave this kit to Gersh, who had a few concerns about how things fit but no real problems assembling it even though he had never done anything like it and only had rudimentary soldering skills. This was probably the easiest kit to assemble. The terminals make it easier to connect leads, although I prefer solder connections for reliability. I would expect a newbie to tin the leads of the wires going into the terminals to make it neater, not knowing that the solder will continue to flow under the screw pressure and eventually loosen up or slip out. This kit would be fine in an old cigar box or fruitcake tin for a first project amplifier. You would need a wall-wart style power supply of about 1A at 24V, and some connectors. I would not use a volume control, but rather the volume control on the personal music player. Next up was the gainclone amplifier kit. The term gainclone originated from a well-regarded stereo power amplifier made by 47 Labs called the Gaincard. It used a very simple circuit with short circuit paths and the National Semiconductor LM3875 IC as the active component. This inspired many to make similar projects. I found a kit on the web from AudioSector that was offered in two versions, one with standard resistors and a second with the bulk metal Vishay resistors and other better parts. I picked the one with the standard parts. One of the parts provided was a miniature metal film resistor. I had previously made distortion measurements on this type of resistor. It has more thermal distortion than larger resistors, but I assumed it was selected because it has more pleasing-to-the-ear even-order harmonic distortion than most resistors. I changed my critical resistors to

the Vishay Dale RN65C 1% equivalents, which were much larger, so I needed to mount them on the circuit board standing up. In my measurements of resistor distortion, these rated among the very best. I expect my version to be more representative of the deluxe version of the kit. This kit came with nicer circuit boards (four total) than all the others, gold-plated double-sided and not run-of-the-mill fiberglass. All the others seemed to be G10 fiberglass single-sided copper. This kit did not come with a heatsink. So I punched out a heatsink that would also hold the power supply card, the amplifier card with the IC, two leftover 18V AC 50VA leftover transformers, a fuse holder, and an IEC input connector. These were designed to mount on the back of my test loudspeakers to make them powered speakers. I needed to refer to the website for directions in assembling the four circuit cards to make two power supplies and two amplifiers. The power supply cards are designed to support either a center-tapped power transformer or a dual winding version. I assembled them with all of the

provided low switching noise rectifiers to use the two winding version because I was actually using two transformers. The only problem was that the holes for input, power, and output were too small to take my standard 16 gauge MTW wire. I had to clip off a few strands of the conductors to get the wire to fit.
