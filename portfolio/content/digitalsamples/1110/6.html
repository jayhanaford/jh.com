A Push-Pull 7591 Power Amp
Another example of Thai interest in tubes to meet the needs of audio enthusiasts.

have never owned the 7591 power tube because I couldn’t find NOS ones for a reasonable price. I believe most NOS 7591s are replacements for vintage units, such as Fisher, Scott, McIntosh, and countless brands I never heard of. Although 6CM5 is the 7591 in a different base, vintage collectors prefer not to change the tube sockets because it reduces resale value of the unit. Fortunately, JJ Electronic and Electro-Harmonix (www.jj-electronic.sk, www.ehx.com) started making 7591s in recent years. That eased the need for NOS 7591s. Although the retail price is a little higher than other new production tubes, such as 6L6GC or EL34, it’s still a good price ($16-$18 for new production vs $50 for NOS). However, I didn’t own any vintage units, so I decided to build a new one (Photo 1).

NO FEEDBACK DESIGN

Several traditional designs of the 7591 amplifier are based on the Williamson or Mullard design, which has plenty of gain in driver stages, and about 20dB of global negative feedback to reduce this gain and widen the frequency response and lower output impedance. My design went the opposite way by using the 7591 without feedback and had moderate gain in driver stage. The no feedback design made it easy to hear different sound from different brands of tube. I still hope that someday I can find NOS samples to compare to the current production.

DRIVER TUBE

FIGURE 1: 7591 pushpull schematic.

I designed the power section based on the Tung-Sol 7591 datasheet. The suggested bias point for push-pull ultralinear with cathode resistor bias was 420V at the plate, and -21V cathode and current was 88mA (for two tubes). The power output was 26W. With -21V bias, I didn’t need a high mu tube such as 12AX7 or 6SL7, but a triode with a mu
