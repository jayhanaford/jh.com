	<div id="content"  class="content">primary winding, and is thus blocked. I’ve covered enough here for you to understand the basics of conducted ground loops. As you can imagine, ground loops can also involve higher frequencies and stray capacitances. For example, Fig. 16 shows how inter-winding capacitance (capacitance between the primary and secondary windings of the isolation transformer) can form a high-frequency ground loop return path—one reason isolation transformers without internal shields are not very effective at high frequencies. As car manufacturers appreciate this problem, they will probably build isolation into their AUX inputs. But for now, it is a classic example of a conducted ground loop. The simple principles I have used in this example apply to all sound systems—indeed they apply to all electronic systems. 1. All current must return back to its specific, original source. 2. Current will take every available return path back to its source. 3. Stray current flowing in signal returns causes noise. 4. Be suspicious of multiple return connections between electronics. 5. Know where your currents are flowing! So the next time you hear an unwanted hum or hiss, you can diagnose the problem by applying these basic principles and sketching simplified schematics. aX

CONTRIBUTORS

Bill Reeve (“Ground Loop Basics”) is a Director at Lockheed Martin Corporation in Palo Alto, Calif. He has graduate engineering degrees from the Colorado School of Mines and the University of California, Berkeley as well as a Masters in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University. Jan Didden (“audioXpress visits Aalt-Jouk van den Hul”) built his first OTL amp with 807 tubes 35 years ago. He has built speakers, preamps, and tape recorders, but is most interested in power amps, especially using error correction as discussed by Hawksford. Many of his projects have been published by audioXpress. Now retired from a career with the Netherlands Airforce and NATO, he tries to complete all those half-finished projects accumulated for lack of time. He now also has the time to travel to interesting audio events and interview audio luminaries. His projects are documented on his Linear Audio website (www.linearaudio.nl). David A. Rich (Review: Infinity Classia C336 Floor Standing Speaker) received his MSEE from Columbia University and his Ph.D. from Polytechnic University of NYU. He specializes in the design of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits and has taught graduate and undergraduate courses in integrated electronics and electroacoustics. Student work under his guidance, including a novel high-efficiency mixed-signal integrated power amplifier, has won numerous awards. His industrial positions include Technical Manager at Bell Laboratories. His portfolio has spanned the design of audio ICs for Air Force One to RF ICs for wireless cell phones, and his innovations have earned 14 patents. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and has frequently served as chairperson for technical and panel sessions at IEEE conferences. He has been a member of the AES signal processing technical committee and has been Technical Editor for Audio Critic. He is the head of the music committee of the Bethlehem Chamber Music Society.
