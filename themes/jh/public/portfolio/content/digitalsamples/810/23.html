	<div id="content"  class="content">play back such a file in the best quality possible. Or, for that matter, what if the recording was in a 24 bit 192kHz format. You would expect to find the answer to this question at a show like this, with its many products on display. For instance, if you look at the record-breaking number of mastodon-size LP turntables at this show, you see that no effort is spared to get the best out of an “old” LP disc. I was rather disappointed that many efforts to play back digital audio recordings were limited to gadgets. Of course, with some effort you can find equipment that will play back a high-quality Dawn Langstroth track, but it seems that more attention is given to Internet Radio, visual presentation, Wifi, and PC software. I vented my frustration to Christian Rechenbach, who is responsible for the German digital audio only magazine “Eins-Null” (meaning one-zero). He was expecting more high-quality digital equipment at the show as well. “May be more before Christmas,” he said. “Most companies do not want to miss the boat and are looking more to each other than the consumer.” But it is a “when” and not an “if.” So at the end of the last day of the show, when all crews were preparing to pack the monster turntables in large crates, some of the workers looked rather happy. The Eyjafjallajokul volcano in Iceland made flying from Munich impossible, but as the sun was still shining after all the heavy lifting, at least there was some extra time to spend in one of those Bavarian beer gardens where the audio discussions went on.
