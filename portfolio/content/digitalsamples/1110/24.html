PREAMP CORRECTIONS
I just received the August issue of audioXpress and I really enjoyed reading it. Thanks for the good and interesting publication! There is a small glitch I would like to point out: In the preamp article (“The Metz Preamp”) on page 10 the headphone amplifier circuit in the lower left corner, has a few mistakes: 1. The part numbers of the output devices do not correspond to the part list 2. The symbols of the output devices are actually not correct—the upper device is a n-channel device, where the little arrow should be pointing inwards, not outwards. The same with the lower device; it’s a p-channel, so the arrow should be pointing outwards. The gate/drain/source connections appear to be correct, however. Another small point: given the part numbers of the output devices, it appears that these are in a DPak package, which is an SMD package. Given the power dissipation of 0.6W at idle (15V × 0.04A), I suggest using IPaks or TO220 with a little heatsink to improve reliability. Alfred Hesener hesenera@netscape.net
Reinhard Metz responds: Thank you for your interest in the preamp article. You are correct on all counts—there was a change in the headphone amp FET selection and the parts list is correct—the change was not picked up on the schematic. The N and P channel symbols are indeed reversed in the schematic, while the Q1/Q2 numbers do correctly correspond to the parts list. Q1 is the N channel and Q2 is the P channel. Concerning the idle dissipation, I agree it may be a reliability improvement to use TO220 versions of Q1 and Q2, although I have found on my prototypes that the ground plane does a decent job of spreading the heat. Also, if a builder uses a signal generator and oscilloscope or distortion analyzer to set bias, it is likely that a lower current than 40mA will achieve a satisfactory bias point, thereby also decreasing the dissipation somewhat.

ers, published in the July issue (p. 18). While it was for the most part rather accurate and relevant in what it discussed, the most important findings of the book, dealing with the flaws of voltage drive, were not really considered. Also, there appeared some notions and interpretations in the review that deserve amendment. Some excerpts from the review: “According to conventional wisdom, there are two very good reasons why voltage drive is used universally: loudspeaker resonance and damping.” Here, I have to wonder about the words “two” and “very good.” The damping of a loudspeaker’s resonance is a single well-defined task to be performed; and once done in the frequency domain, the time domain will automatically settle in place since the time behavior of a linear system is always only a reflection of its frequency behavior, as determined by the Fourier transform relationship. The back-EMF can really be called back-EMF only near the resonant frequency where this voltage acts approximately in phase with the applied signal, thus reducing the flow of current on voltage drive and hence affecting the damping. However, it can be shown by basic modeling and measurement that when frequency rises from the resonance area, the EMF soon turns perpendicular to the current and at the same time decreases in magnitude, falling below the resistive voltage somewhere between 100 and 200Hz. Thus, throughout the whole mid-frequency region, the EMF, which is now a perpendicular EMF, does not damp or control anything but acts merely as an uncontrolled interference source, playing havoc with the crucial voltage-to-current conversion. So, electrical damping is nonexistent beyond an octave or two from the resonance; and in the resonance region it can be substituted in all aspects by mechanical damping with the same outcome. Thus, there is not any valid reason, let alone very good ones, to perform against the clear directive of the governing law F= Bli, especially in the middle and treble regions. It is also fully feasible to use some amount of passive electrical damping for bass and increase the impedance level for other frequencies, where the benefits of current-drive mostly appear.

“In other words, implementation of these ideas requires a system approach, as can be done effectively with powered loudspeaker products.” In principle, there is dualism between the two modes of operation, and current-drive does not necessitate system approach more than voltage drive does. As I have demonstrated, passive speakers with flat-response amplifiers can also be made to work. With dedicated amplification for each driver, the source impedance can be kept more ideal, but just the same kind of restrictions apply when one is striving for ideal voltage drive. “Most of his objections to voltage drive stem from the back-EMF...” Here, we come to the main omission of the review. The objections to voltage drive are only halfway due to the motional EMF. The effects of the inductance EMF are at least as grave, but this major issue was not even given a mention. (The voltage across any inductance, in this case that of the voice coil, is also an EMF, as it is induced by a fluctuating magnetic field.) The most important chapter of the book is #4, where the flaws of voltage drive are demonstrated; and without an idea of these phenomena, readers are not able to make any reasoned judgments on the subject. Trying to reproduce some of these effects would have been more useful and revealing than just focusing all attention on the bass region damping, as the loudspeakers could not be modified. “What we call current drive is, in reality, a voltage source in which the voltage is automatically and instantaneously adjusted up or down, to maintain the desired current.” So it can be said if we are using a usual voltage mode output stage. It is also possible to employ a current mode output stage, in which case we are adjusting only current and can also achieve higher output impedances. “It seems that the reverse current generated by spurious cone movement “distorted” the voltage drive net current in such a way as to correct some of the distortion.” This is due to the partial velocity feedback effect that occurs within an octave or so from the resonant point but is ineffective at other frequencies, where the EMF current is smaller and perpendicular to the applied signal.
