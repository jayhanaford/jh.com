	<div id="content"  class="content">Solen is bringing you the first audiophile grade two-way monitor amplifiers for the DIY market. Using all Polystyrene or Polypropylene capacitors in the signal path, gold plated RCA socket, removable IEC power chord and a high output power transformer.

AP-016

$94.50
The AP-016 is available in three versions. The AP-016A crossover point is at 2Khz, the AP-016B is at 2.7KHz and the AP-016C is at 3.5KHz. All of them are 4th order Linkwitz-Riley crossover. Specifications: HF Power Output: 30Wrms LF Power Output: 80Wrms THD: 0.03% S/N ratio @ rated W: 90db Input sensitivity: 1V Input impedance: 22Kohms 4th order X-over: 2KHz AP-016A 2.7KHz AP-016B 3.5KHz AP-016C Weight: 2.6Kgs (5.7lbs) Dimensions W x H x D: W: 137mm (5.4") H: 218mm (8.6") D: 81mm (3.2") Cut-Out W x H: W: 108mm (4.25") H: 190mm (7.5") AC Voltage: 115V / 230V

the grid resistor for cathode bias. This may cause instability for new production tubes. Many tube dealers recommend reducing the value to 150-200kΩ to avoid the problem. I chose 180kΩ, which was more than enough for the 10kΩ plate resistance of ECC40. I used 0.47µF coupling cap because I have many of them. You can use 0.22µF without losing low-frequency response. The total 7591’s plate and screen grid dissipation is about 16W, which is well below 22W (19W for plate and 3W for screen grid). So, the power tubes should have full life service. The output transformer I chose was Hammond 1650F. With 7.8kΩ primary impedance, I got 20W RMS with good frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz. Not bad for a non-NFB power amp. I may get more power with lower primary impedance, but I don’t have other output transformers to try. You can use the female XLR connector for a balanced input connection. Just solder two wires from the input transformer’s primary to pin 2 and 3 of the connector. Then solder pin 1 to the chassis ground. If you don’t have an input transformer for the phase inverter, you can use a balance driver IC such as the Burr-Brown DRV134. Or you may use a unity-gain stable op amp for the phase inversion job. Figure 3 shows a simple phase inverter using Analog Devices OP275.

CONSTRUCTION

I built this power amp for bedroom listening, so I needed to squeeze everything into a small chassis. To do that, I

cut an aluminum plate and drilled holes for sockets, output transformers, and the power transformer. First, I assembled the amplifier circuit. Then, I mounted the output transformers and connected the primary wires to the output tubes. I also mounted the power transformer during this step because I needed to connect filament wire to the tubes before stacking the power supply board on top (Photo 2). I assembled the HT power supply on a blank fiberglass board with holes drilled for filter capacitors and solder terminal. I mounted the power supply board on another aluminum plate, to be installed on the top of the amplifier circuit later. If you do it the same way I did, you need to make sure that you have enough clearance between the amplifier circuit and the aluminum plate. Photo 3 shows how the amplifier circuit and power supply aluminum plate mount together. I also cut another fiberglass board and drilled holes for solder terminals and soldered on 10M45s, anode stopper, and an adjustment resistor. This way, I was able to set the current of the 10M45s before installing the board on the aluminum plate. I placed the 10M45’s board next to the power supply board to keep the wiring short (Photo 4). I tested the amplifier in “nude” assembly before placing it in the aluminum chassis. Finally, I placed the aluminum chassis in a wood frame, which I had input-transformer-mounted behind the front panel. I did that because the input transformer was very sensitive to hum that’s caused by the power transformer.
