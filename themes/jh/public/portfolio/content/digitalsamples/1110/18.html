	<div id="content"  class="content">These amplifiers made a nice stereo pair and met my expectations for a reasonably high-quality amplifier. I would not rate this an easy-to-assemble kit because of the options offered. A beginner might be able to get it to work, but might require some guidance. Again, with this kit more parts are needed to make a complete amplifier. Include a heatsink to the list of parts. You also may wish to use a stepped attenuator instead of a standard plastic film volume control. Don’t even think of using a cheap carbon volume control. Dave assembled the final kit, which was from AmpsLab Lm60. Dave has previously built an amplifier on a breadboard and is skilled at soldering. I also punched a heatsink for this kit. The kit contained a CD with instructions, and all discrete parts using depletion mode power FETs for the output devices and was only a single channel. It did not include any power supply parts. A 30-0-30V transformer (60V center tapped) with at least 10,000µF capacitors rated at 50V was recommended. I really had to search my junkbox, but I found a nice hefty transformer that unloaded was 62V and center-tapped. I had some

10,000 at 63V capacitors and a nice 15A 200V diode bridge. I cobbled these into the power supply. I had to solder wires to the PC card to make connections. Like the gainclone cards, the holes were not large enough for my stock 16 gauge wire. This kit, unlike all of the others, required adjustments. After hooking up the power supply, I set up my voltmeter and light bulb box to adjust the output voltage trim and FET bias. A quick check showed the output was at –40V. The light bulb in series with the AC line did not light up, which means at least I probably did not fry anything. A quick check showed that the PC board ground traces at the input were also at –40V. A bit of investigating showed that jumper #2 was missing. It should have been installed below one of the output power resistors to continue the ground circuit from the output side of the board to the input. Making sure the power supply capacitors were discharged, I soldered in the missing jumper on the bottom of the PC card. When I asked Dave about it, he mentioned he could not find where J2 was located and assumed the PC layout had changed and it was no longer needed. After reassembling everything, I tried

again. It worked. The output voltage trimmer started at 30mV or so and trimmed to just a few with ease. The output bias trimmer was a ten-turn type, so when setting it to minimum value as per the directions, you really don’t know when you are there, so give it at least ten turns to be sure. The final adjustment of the bias was fairly easy, and not very far from the no bias end of adjustment. This amplifier card is clearly intended to be a project amplifier. A nice front panel, a decent chassis, and other parts are in order. You might consider this for a multi-channel amplifier. Sound quality was quite pleasant.

MEASUREMENTS

Figure 1 shows the distortion + noise of

the amplifiers (using one channel of the stereo amplifiers) into an 8Ω resistor versus the input drive level. You could easily misinterpret these curves. All of the amplifiers start out showing what appears to be 1% or more distortion. This is usually just noise, and is why the distortion appears to drop as the level increases. What is clear is that the gainclone and the Lm60 had superior performance. What was not clear is whether
