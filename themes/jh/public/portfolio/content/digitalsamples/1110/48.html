er person, hidden from the view, could randomly switch between the speakers. The person needs to be hidden to avoid facial expressions from supplying clues to which speaker is playing. As far as I can tell, the folks who go to this trouble today are working for the Audioholics website (www.audioholics. com). You can replace the person with an electronic box that does the random switching, but these are no longer commercially available. It is not a trivial task to design such a box, especially when switching speaker cables. I find it easier to drive each speaker with its own power amp and switch at line level. I wimped out and listened to the C336 comparing them sighted to other speakers in the room at matched levels. One reason was the other speakers available were of sufficiently different sizes and voicings they could be easily identified. Unfortunately, I could not directly compare the Infinity Beta 40 because I sent it back long ago. I also used headphones to gauge the quality of my source material with the room taken out of the picture. In the end, the C336 sounds like it measures. That was, after all, the objective when the speaker was designed, so the on-axis, early reflections, and sound power track each other and remain monotonic. Compared to most speakers, the C336 has a more apparent topend which correlates with my measurements, both with the quasi-anechoic listening window (Fig. 1) and the inroom measurements (Fig. 4). The absence of any dip in the 2–3kHz area did appear to make the speaker more sensitive to the quality of the recording. Close miked recordings with lots of post-production EQ became fatiguing to listen to. Of course, what is needed to make these recordings sound better is a parametric EQ to add in the dip and reduce the high end. Of interest is that many room EQ systems offer just this in the optional target curves. Dips at around 2kHz and options for increased highE18 frequency rolloff are available. At the end of the day, the C336 is a more accurate loudspeaker compared to those voiced to taste. Such a speaker is much easier to EQ for badly produced recording than one that is already voiced and may have inherited poor early reflection frequency response curves in the process. That said, a control to reduce the top-end would have been useful as provided on some Harman-branded Revel and JBL Pro models. Most users do not have the appropriate equalizer in the signal path. Down at the bottom, the speaker performed similarly to other floor-standing speakers with similar low-frequency cutoffs, but the C336 might have been a little cleaner at higher SPLs. I expect the real differences are apparent only when testing SPLs higher than I was willing to tolerate. In the frequency range of the midrange and tweeter, the C336 produces cleaner sound than the other speakers I had on hand at high SPL levels that I could tolerate higher. I tried using the Anthem ARC room EQ to flatten the response of the C336 and the other speaker under test. The Anthem permits you to limit the lowest frequency to which the EQ is applied. I made sure the C336 low-end rolloff was unaffected by the EQ. The Anthem also limits the upper frequency to which it corrects. I set it at 300Hz, which is the room-dominated area. The subjective result of the EQ was similar for the C336 as other floorstanding speakers I have tested. The level of adjacent notes smoothes out in the low brass, double bass, and tympani. The sound quality also changes as the first harmonics are brought into correct relation to the fundamental of the instrument. I recommend a good recording of the Britten “Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra” to hear these effects since the score isolates different sections of the orchestra. The double bass section playing in the low register is especially telling, as is the tympani section. I was bothered by one subjective efwww.audioXpress .com

fect that does not show up clearly in the measurements. This is a tall speaker with the big array of three 6.5″ woofers at the bottom and the 4″ midrange and tweeter close to the top. This resulted in a subjective impression that the violins appear to be coming closer to the top of the speaker while the trombones and cellos sound as though they are further down the speaker. I tried the speaker at distances between 7 and 10′ with little change in the effect. I thought the 600Hz response dip might have something to do with this, so I used the Anthem ARC room EQ system to remove the 600Hz dip, but did not allow it to EQ above one 1kHz. No improvement. Removing the 600Hz dip did not make a significant change in the tonal balance of the speaker. I think the speakers’ very flat response from 2kHz up to 15kHz may be partially responsible for the effect. With more energy coming from the top of the speaker, there is a greater tendency to localize the midrange/tweeter array. I have not seen many reviews about this sort of effect in tall towers and I may be more sensitive to it than most people. You will be able to quickly tell whether you are sensitive to it when you audition the C336. I expect a lower crossover point between the midrange and woofer would have solved the problem, but would have resulted in added cost in the midrange design to get it to go lower without increased distortion or compression. In conclusion, the speakers measured better than others I recently auditioned, and subjective performance corroborated the results. Its excellent performance is obvious when compared to other similarly priced speaker designs with stylish real wood cabinets and more than three woofers in the so-called 2.5-way configurations that do not have an isolated midrange. The speaker has little identifiable colorations above the room-dominated area above 300Hz, and its dynamic limits are above levels at which I am willing to listen. rr
