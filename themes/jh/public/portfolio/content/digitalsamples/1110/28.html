Therefore, a sound reproduction transducer will sound the most natural when it reproduces the sound contained on the program device as closely as possible to the original— not the original sound but the signal that left the microphone terminals and was modified by the production team. The way you test for that is to measure sound pressure and directivity. The more closely the sound pressure matches the test signal (usually a noise source), the more natural it will sound. Why, then, do people “prefer” different speakers? Well, none of them is perfect, not even the JBL, and there are tons of nuisance bias sources available that influence preference. That’s one thing about measurements—they don’t care about preference—and they also can be imperfectly used, but at least they can’t “prefer” a given source of imperfection over another. However, there’s more to it than middle level frequency response. Dynamics are also an issue. But you can measure those, too. In my case I test the low-frequency capability with the Linkwitz/Keele 6.5 cycle ramped sine signal. It’s not a true sine wave, but it allows you to drive the speaker into overload without burning it out. I drive the speaker with a 1/3 octave preferred frequency until 10% distortion is reached. I use 10% because at that level of sound pressure the speaker will still sound “clean,” but any further drive will cause distortion to increase exponentially as it moves into nonlinearity. So, yes, measurements are a key factor in speaker evaluation. Because no speaker is perfect, sometimes you need to interpret the value of imperfections with listening, but the more even the frequency response on- and off-axis, the more likely the speaker will sound natural and mimic the actual source. Therefore, the most even response with regard to sound pressure will sound the most like the recording as long as the system has the requisite dynamic capability. And a noise signal with proper averaging and display will tell you which speakers will sound the most natural. I got my first pair of JBL LSRs in June of 2005. I was really impressed and bought that pair as review samples and replaced my dipolar side surround speakers (Paradigm Active ADP-450) with them. Then as I began upgrading my bedroom system, I acquired three more units to use as left, center, and right front channel speakers in 2006 and 2007. So my samples reported here are all 3-5 years old and allow you to see whether JBL could make the same speaker twice (sometimes manufacturers have difficulty with that) and whether they retain their new performance over time.

MEASUREMENTS
Frequency response: • Monitor on-axis 85Hz to 20kHz ±2.3dB Bass Limit: • Monitor: 92dB SPL at 62Hz at 2m (<10% distortion) Control Action: Monitor: •	80Hz high pass: actual frequency = 97Hz • +1.5dB at 2.2kHz: actual response +1.3dB at 2.2kHz • -1.5dB at 2.2kHz: actual response -1.6dB at 2.2kHz • Boundary compensation: begins at 500Hz with -2dB at 150Hz and -4.5dB at 62Hz I used the figure of merit 10% distortion because operating characteristics of drivers (using DLC Design DUMAX) show that when a speaker has reached the end of its linear operating range (BL product has fallen to 70% of the rest position value or the suspension compliance has increased by a factor of 4), the unit will still sound clean, but distortion increases exponentially with further drive. The early (2005) LSR6325P Studio Monitor has incredibly smooth frequency response (Fig. 1, which actually shows two curves. The first was taken when the speaker was new (2005) and then five years later). The speaker has retained as-new performance for at least five years. The 2005 pair were the flattest loudspeakers I ever tested. The early (2005) speaker had excellent
