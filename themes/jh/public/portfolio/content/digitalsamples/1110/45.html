ficacy of monotonic off-axis radiation patterns. You can get more details by searching on the web for Dr. Toole’s online paper “Making a good loudspeaker—Imaging, space and great sound in rooms.” Figure 3 is the vertical radiation pattern from -15 to +20° off the tweeter axis in 5° increments 1m back. Emmanuel Millot pointed out that the angles are double to what the listener hears 2+ meters back, so these measurements are stressing the limit of the speaker. Despite this, there is almost no activity above 1500Hz, which is an octave below the crossover to the tweeter. Harman’s philosophy is to keep the off-axis response as close as possible in overall shape to a listening window response. In this case, the reflections are off the wall and ceiling. Of course, the response declines above 8kHz as the microphone becomes significantly off-axis to the tweeter. The off-axis tweeter response is also determined by the oval-shaped tweeter waveguide. With the oval shape, the horizontal and vertical radiation of the tweeter can be independently controlled. Typical speaker designs have an energy dip around the crossover frequency due to interaction between the noncoincident speakers as different vertical angles alter the path length between the speakers. I wrote a tutorial on crossover design and driver interactions in the Dec./Jan. 2006 issue (#108) of Sensible Sound. This is the same issue containing the Infinity Beta 40 review. Many listeners prefer the dip in the 2-3kHz range, which is sometimes called the BBC or Gundry dip. Some speaker manufacturers intentionally increase the size of the dip as the “voice” of the speaker by pairing certain types of drivers and crossovers. In general, some dip is unavoidable, but it is missing from the C336 as can be seen in Fig. 3. Depending on the Gundry dip’s depth and width, the sound stage sometimes backs away from the listener and may make the speaker more

forgiving of sub-optimal source material. Dr. Toole has named this type of voicing methodology the circle of confusion: “Listening through loudspeakers that are evaluated by recordings made with microphones that were evaluated by listening through loudspeakers.” Even the Infinity Beta 40 has a small dip due to its larger midrange, which has center further away from the center of the tweeter than the 4″ driver in the C336. But this alone cannot account for the absence of the dip in the C336. Improved engineering in the crossover also results in more desirable vertical radiation patterns. Moreover, the tweeter waveguide has evolved over time. Examining the vertical radiation patterns around the 600Hz crossover from the woofer to midrange is more difficult because the C336 is too heavy to lift from the floor and the curves become room dependent as the microphone is lowered to get the radiation pattern in the negative direction. My attempt to converge the three woofers and the midrange at 1m will not be accurate. Moving to 2m renders the quasi-anechoic measurement useless because the reflected sound comes almost as fast as the first arrival providing no way

to window it out. Accordingly, take the section of Fig. 3 below 1kHz with a grain of salt. ROOM RESPONSE Figure 4 is the in-room performance of the speaker. I placed the speaker in my large family room that is 19 by 18 with a complex ceiling whose height runs from 12′ at the sides to 16′ at the center. The graphs in Fig. 4 are an average of nine points taken around a 2 × 3′ square around the prime listening position, which is about 9′ back from the speaker. I placed the microphone at ear level for all nine measurements. As with all my measurements, the grille was removed. With the AcoustiSoft RplusD software, a measurement like this can be done in only a few minutes since it automatically rolls each new measurement into the average. To bring out response changes of the speaker in Fig. 4, I used a tight 0.1 octave smoothing for this graph. To achieve resolution to 20Hz, I set the gate time of the measurement system to 1 second, which essentially makes the measurements equivalent to an RTA but with a higher resolution than the one-third octave response those
