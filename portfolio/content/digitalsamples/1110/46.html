speakers in-room. The Beta 40s highend started to roll off around 8kHz and was down 2 or 3dB below the C336 at 15kHz. I cannot directly compare them since I measured the Beta 40 in a different room with different software. Figure 4 shows a sizeable dip in response at 600Hz as well as 250Hz. I tried all sorts of speaker and listening chair placements, but I could not get these to go away. The 600Hz dip is also evident in the listening window plot of Fig. 1. I had never seen these sort of dips in this listening room before from other speakers, although I have not tested a 3-woofer 3-way design before. With this configuration uncharted waters for me, I needed to refer to Harman engineers. Emmanuel Millot writes: “The overall woofer response encompasses transducer response, the low frequency alignment and other factors such as enclosure diffraction. In the C336, the result is a rising amplitude response with steps at 250 and 600Hz. When combined with the passive network, these steps manifest themselves as the 200 and 600Hz dips in the system response you have noted.” This is best understood with reference to anechoic frequency response curves in Figs. 5 and 6 that were supplied by Emmanuel Millot. Figure 5 is the response of the three woofers alone, and you can see the steps in the amplitude response. Figure 6 is the response of the three woofers with the 600Hz crossover with a rolloff of a 4th-order LR network with the resulting dips. Figures 5 and 6 show the direct response(A), the listening window(B), the sound power (C), and (D) the directivity index (the difference between the listening window response and the sound power). For the discussion here, concentrate on trace A. My vertical response curve was not reliable because the speaker was on the floor and the quasi-anechoic measurement failed, not only because I could not window out reflection, but 1m was

devices provide. The 24dB span in the vertical axis is tight for an in-room response curve emphasizing variation in the amplitude response. I show the speaker in two different positions in the room to separate room boundary effects from the speaker’s intrinsic performance. Given the room size, many speaker placements are feasible. As I have said in the past, a graph of the in room performance of a speaker cannot alone reflect the total performance of the speaker. As Dr. Toole details in his papers, the direct listening window response along with the first bounce reflections from the walls, the ceiling, and floor are equally important in the speaker-dominated region above 300Hz. Figures 1–3 cull the data that the room response cannot provide. That said, you can still get some significant information from the room response. The low-frequency limit at 6dB for both positions is 50Hz, about the same as the Beta 40. As I mentioned previously, the C336 might appear bigger than the Beta 40, but its internal volume is about the same. Does the extra woofer of the C336 offer an advantage? Perhaps, with the slightly higher sensitivity between 0.5 and 1dB that I measured around 90dB SPL. I asked designer Emmanuel Millot to shed more light on the extra woofer E16

in the C336, and he replied, “The design goals for the C336 were high output capability, low distortion, and low power compression.” In the absence of an isolated room to deal with a 100dB SPL test level, power compression tests were not possible. High ambient room noise prevents me from measuring distortion. For this reason, I cannot objectively demonstrate the advantage of the woofer. You can see why I delayed publication until I had someone who could answer these key questions. The C336 played very cleanly at the highest amplitude levels; I could play big classical scores within its low-frequency limit. The shape of the curves in the room dominating this portion of the spectrum (below 200Hz) in Fig. 4 are similar to what I measured for other tower speakers with two woofers in the same position, suggesting the C336 has flat anechoic response at the bottom end and it is not boosted up to move fast off the floor at the dealer. The virtual absence of the 2–3kHz dip in Fig. 4 is expected against the backdrop of the 1m quasi-anechoic measurements in Figs. 2 and 3. At 15kHz, the top end is only 2dB down from the midband response. Some of this is due to the 15kHz resonance of the tweeter, but, even in its absence, the C336 has a stronger top end than most
