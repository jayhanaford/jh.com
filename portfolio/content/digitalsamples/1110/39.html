	<div id="content"  class="content">DGG also used quite aggressive A/D converters for their first digital recordings, which I thought were not very good. There was a lot of justified criticism but also a lot of praise for that crystal-clear digital sound, which I never understood. I mean, you’ve got ears, don’t you? You just had to listen to know it was a step backwards from good analog. But it’s extremely difficult to be objective, not to be dragged along with the mainstream, and influenced by expectations, and experiences in your youth. Your taste for music, for instance, is very strongly determined by what you are exposed to when young. In my case it was the church organ. My father was the church organist and always played that music on the home organ. I remember that one day, early in the war, my father was playing Maarten Luther’s “A strong castle is our lord” when a German military unit came to arrest him. The unit leader was also an organ player and he joined

my father and they played together for a while. After they finished, the Germans left, to come back two minutes later to formally arrest my father, who, of course, was no longer there. A moment of humanity in a sea of madness that was. JD: I remember that you used to write articles for the audio press, but haven’t seen any lately. Is it something you stopped doing? VDH: I’m not a journalist by trade; I wrote a few articles at the request of some early Dutch technical periodicals. Then at a certain point I wrote an article on a comparative test of a trio of video recorder technologies Betamax, Video 2000, and VHS. Unfortunately, my conclusions didn’t align with the marketing and advertising stories. My article was changed beyond recognition, and I went into the editor’s office and symbolically handed in my pencil. I stopped writing for periodicals but

continued to put my thoughts in writing, as witnessed by my articles on the van den Hul website (www.vandenhul. com). JD: Since you mentioned cables, can we talk a little about that? I remember when you came out with your carbon interlinks; I thought: Huh? How can that improve anything? VDH: Ahhh! You see, when I worked with those tiny wires I started to become interested in what actually happens in a conductor and what can go wrong, so it was back to the study room again! The standard story is, of course, that electrons are responsible for transporting electrical current through a conductor, but that’s only part of the story. It is accompanied by a modulated electromagnetic field. I visualize the process more in terms of electromagnetic fields than of electrons moving around, although both views are largely equivalent. It’s just that the electromagnetic field view is easier for me.
