The TM1, which is characterized with a uniformly controlled omnidirectional polar pattern and a frequency range over 20Hz-25kHz, is targeted for use by sound engineers, sound companies, and recording enthusiasts. Requiring 18-52V phantom power for operation, the TM1 features a precision-machined 4-stage brass body and capsule housing, nickel-plate finish, Switchcraft XLR, shock-absorbent O-rings, and heavy-duty snap-to-fit mike clip. Optional accessories include an acoustic foam windscreen (WS-TM1) that threads onto the microphone housing for secure and stable operation, and a shockmount adapter (SMT-TM1). Specifications are as follows: Transducer type: pre-polarized condenser Frequency response: 20Hz - 25kHz ±2dB Polar pattern: Omni Output impedance: 200Ω Sensitivity: 6.5mV/Pa at 1k Maximum SPL: 130dB with distortion < 1% 140dB maximum Signal to noise ratio: 66dB Equivalent noise level: 28dB (A weighted) Dynamic range: 112dB Power requirements: 18-52V phantom Connector: Switchcraft male XLR Polarity: Positive pressure on diaphragm produces positive voltage on pin 2 relative to pin 3 of output XLR connector Housing: 4 piece precision machined brass finish nickel Length: 150mm/5.9″ List price for the TM1 is $299.
