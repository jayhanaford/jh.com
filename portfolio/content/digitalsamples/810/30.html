	<div id="content"  class="content">speakers. The design is promoted as providing a clean, near-invisible appearance that doesn’t conflict with a room’s interior design. The flange is only 0.2″ wide. The grille protrudes less from a wall than many grilles on the market for a less obtrusive appearance, according to Sonance. The subs, which began shipping in June, are the $700 10″ 250W SUB10-250 and $1,000 12″ 500W SUB12500. Their companion enclosures are priced, respectively, at $700 and $1,000. Each sub is designed for use with a matching outboard Class D mono amp. A $700 250W amp is designed for the SUB10-250, and a $1,000 500W amp is designed for the SUB12-500. Each amp can drive two of the subwoofers. The 10″ sub extends response down to 30Hz, and when used with its matching amp, produces 108dB SPLs at 1m. The SUB12-500 extends to 25Hz and produces 114dB at 1m with matching amp. Their enclosures fit in standard 2 × 4 stud bays and come with a blank pre-construction plate that is included for easy installation. To deliver the rated output from a low-profile driver, Sonance turned in part to a 4″ diameter voice coil, which is capable of handling continuously high levels of power. The large voice coil also let Sonance place dual spiders inside the voice coil to reduce depth and maximize the linear movement of each sub’s laminated carbon fiber honeycomb woofer cone. The inside spiders also overcame another drawback of shallow woofers. According to the company, “In most shallow woofers, due to the short distance from the surround to the spider, the cones have a tendency to rock. This rocking requires the use of a larger gap in the motor to reduce the output of the driver.” The outboard amps incorporate speaker-level high-pass filters designed specifically to complement the sonic characteristics of the drivers. The subs’ enclosures are made of ½″ and 1″ MDF to isolate bass sounds and use extruded-aluminum bracing to minimize airflow obstructions. Mass damping of the enclo-

sures’ front and back walls, combined with fiberglass internal damping, dissipate standing waves, and a floating enclosure design minimizes vibration transfer to adjoining rooms. Definitive Technology (www.definitivetech.com) plans to introduce three more super-thin speakers later this year to join the 1.5″ deep Mythos XTR-50, a $699 two-way LCR designed to complement ever-thinner LED-backlit LCD TVs. The 27″ × 6″ × 1.5″ XTR-50, sized for use with 46 to 55″ flat-panel TVs, can be mounted horizontally or vertically on walls or stands. It’s positioned as the market’s thinnest component speaker that can be placed up against a wall. The additional models will be positioned above and below the current model in price point and length, but like the XTR-50, they will be only 1.5″ deep at their maximum depth at the center of their enclosures, which become thinner toward their edges. Definitive will introduce the new models at the CEDIA Expo in September and ship them later in the year. Strongly rising sales of LED-backlit LCD TVs are producing new opportunities to improve TV sound quality, especially when the TV speakers fire downward like many current models. Definitive thinned out the XTR-50 using dynamic drivers instead of turning to flat-panel drivers. Definitive also avoided electrostatic and ribbon technology for multiple reasons, including expense and a bipolar-radiation pattern that prevents them from being placed up against a wall. To get dynamic drivers into a 1.5″ deep chassis, Definitive incorporated dome drivers instead of traditional cone drivers, enabling the company to place the voice coil inside the dome to reduce depth. Another strategy was allowing small neodymium magnets to protrude through the enclosure’s back panel while remaining flush with the back of the enclosure. A gasket around the magnet prevents air leakage and conducts heat to the aluminum back panel, turning the back panel into a heatsink. VC
