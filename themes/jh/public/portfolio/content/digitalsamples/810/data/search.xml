ALMA,	 the	 International	 Loudspeaker	 Association,	 Board	 of	 Directors	 has	 announced	 a	 number	 of	 midyear	accomplishments	and	outlined	some	ambitious	new	 plans.	This	 includes	 a	 new	 ALMA	 website;	 the	 creation	 of	 ALMA	 student	 chapters	 and	 the	 genesis	 of	 a	 student	 loudspeaker	 design	 competition;	 a	 50th	 anniversary	 gala	 event	featuring	the	introduction	of	industry	award	recognition	along	with	a	powerful	winter	symposium	program;	 and	 an	 important	 industry	 collaboration	 with	 a	 Chinese	 loudspeaker	association. ALMA	 management	 is	 in	 the	 process	 of	 implementing	 new	 association	 management	 software	 that	 includes	 an	 upgrade	to	a	first-class	website	that	will	simplify,	improve,	 and	automate	the	member	experience	and	will	better	facilitate	 online	 community	 needs.	 Carol	 Bousquet,	 ALMA’s	 new	 Executive	 Director,	 said,	 “It’s	 all	 about	 customer	 service—meeting	the	needs	of	our	members,	building	community	and	creating	a	favorable	member	experience	so	that	 we	can	focus	on	what’s	most	important.	.	.	our	organization!	 The	 ALMA	 board	 of	 directors	 is	 committed	 to	 providing	 value	 in	 exchange	 for	 member	 investment;	 after	 all,	 they	 pay	 dues	 too	 and	 realize	 first-hand	 how	 important	 every	 organizational	and	member	dollar	is.	The	50th	anniversary	 of	ALMA	has	given	us	a	timely	opportunity	to	review	how	 we	do	business	and	how	we	offer	world-class	programs	in	 order	 to	 constantly	 improve	 how	 we	 meet	 our	 members’	 needs	and	grow	the	only	professional	association	dedicated	 to	 the	 world-wide	 loudspeaker	 industry.

awarded	at	the	gala. The	“gala”	is	a	first-time	event	for	ALMA	and	is	a	departure	 from	 the	 traditional	 and	 coveted	 members-only	 dinner.	The	board	is	extremely	pleased	that	Shawn	Dubravac,	 Chief	Economist	&	Director	of	Research	for	the	Consumer	 Electronics	 Association,	 will	 be	 the	 keynote	 speaker	 at	 ALMA’s	50th	Anniversary	Gala.	Specifically	targeted	to	the	 loudspeaker	industry,	with	the	assistance	of	his	team	of	15	 researchers,	 he	 will	 share	 a	 retrospective,	 current	 research	 and	 prognostication	 about	 the	 future	 marketplace	 and	 consumer	trends! ALMA’s	Student	Loudspeaker	Design	Competition	will	 feature	 qualified	 students	 who’ve	 submitted	 their	 designs	 and	measurements	for	a	pair	of	loudspeakers.	Finalists	will	 be	selected	by	an	ALMA	judging	panel	and	will	be	invited	 to	 display	 their	 speakers	 and	 design	 data	 at	 the	 ALMA	 International	 Winter	 Symposium	 in	 Las	 Vegas	 Jan.	 4-5,	 2011,	 two	 days	 before	 the	 Consumer	 Electronics	 Show	 (CES).	The	 finalists	 will	 receive	 free	 admission	 to	 ALMA	 International’s	 two-day	 winter	 symposium;	 and	 one	 free	 night	at	the	Orleans	Hotel	and	Resort.	The	final	awards	will	 be	presented	at	the	ALMA	50th	Anniversary	Gala	during	 the	symposium.

The	driver	award	will	feature	three	 levels—platinum,	 gold,	 and	 bronze.	 The	 platinum	 driver	 award	will	be	reserved	for	board	emeritus	or	members	who	 have	made	significant,	continued,	and	sustained	contributions	 to	 the	 industry	 over	 the	 lifetime	 of	 their	 career;	 the	 gold	 award	 will	 be	 given	 to	 a	 member	 or	 institution	 that	 deserves	recognition	for	a	singular	and	more	current	accomplishment,	either	within	the	association	or	the	industry;	and	 the	bronze	driver	award	will	be	given	for	accomplishments	 worthy	of	recognition	to	the	newest	or	youngest	members	 of	ALMA. ALMA	 Board	 member	 and	 VP	 Asia,	 Jennifer	 Nee,	 General	 Manager	 of	 Phase	 Design,	 has	 led	 an	 effort	 to	 formalize	 a	 collaboration	 with	 CEAD,	 the	 Chinese	 loudspeaker	 organization;	 the	 result	 being	 a	 commitment	 to	 sharing	 in	 every	 way	 possible	 new	 and	 innovative	 information	 that	 will	 benefit	 all	 members.	 CEAD	 is	 made	 up	 of	 loudspeaker	 engineers	 and	 factory	 directors,	 similar	 to	 the	makeup	of	ALMA.	ALMA	plans	to	celebrate	this	collaboration	at	the	ALMA	Asia	symposium	as	well	as	at	the	 ALMA	Gala	in	January.	The	focus	is	to	improve	how	each	 country	does	business	with	the	other.	A	board	member	of	 each	association	will	become	a	board	member	of	the	other,	 and	in	the	true	spirit	of	collaboration,	will	begin	to	share	 technical	 know-how	 through	 active	 participation	 in	 each	 other’s	symposia	programs.

Titles such as “Relationship between Loudspeaker Measurements and Listen Preferences,” “The Effect of Whole-body Vibrations on Preferred Bass Equalizations of Automotive Audio Systems,” “The Dishonesty of Sighted Listening Tests,” or “What Loudspeaker Specifications are Relevant to Sound Quality?” should be sufficient to pique any loudspeaker engineer’s interest.

Tymphany/Airborne
By Vance Dickason
his month’s Test Bench samples are both home audio drivers. From Tymphany, a 6.5″ woofer from the new Vifa NE line—the NE180W-04. And from Airborne, the wood cone HR124B8-10L midrange (the 5.25″ wood cone woofer version, the FR148B6-17L, was featured in the September 2009 issue).
T
NE180W-04
Like the other Vifa NE series woofers I have reviewed (Voice Coil featured reports on the Vifa NE149 and NE225 in the December 2009 issue, and the NE315 in the July 2010 issue), the 6.5″ NE180W-04 (Photo 1) represents a completely new from-the-ground-up design. As with the other woofers in the NE series, the NE180 incorporates a group of similar features. Starting with the frame, Vifa has designed a proprietary cast aluminum frame that minimizes frame reflections back into the cone, open cooling area below the spider mounting shelf, as well as providing a heatsink for the neodymium motor. The cone and dust cap on all models incorporate a natural wood fiber paper slurry with added proprietary coating to improve clarity (damp surface modes).
and were discarded. As has become the protocol for Test Bench testing, I no longer use a single added mass measurement and instead used actual measured mass, but the manufacturer’s measured Mmd data. Next, I post-processed the remaining eight 550 point stepped sine wave sweeps for each NE180 sample and divided the voltage curves by the current curves (admittance) to derive impedance curves, phase added by the LMS calculation method, and along with the accompanying voltage curves, imported to the LEAP 5 Enclosure Shop software. Because most Thiele/Small data provided by the majority of OEM manufacturers is generated using either the standard model or the LEAP 4 TSL model, I additionally produced a LEAP 4 TSL parameter set using the 1V free-air curves. I selected the complete data set, the multiple voltage impedance curves for the LTD model (see Fig. 1 for the 1V free-air impedance curve) and the 1V impedance curve for the TSL model in the transducer derivation menu in LEAP 5, and produced the parameters for the computer box simulations. Table 1 compares the LEAP 5 LTD and TSL data and factory parameters for both Vifa NE180 samples. LEAP parameter Qts calculation results for the NE180 were reasonably close to the factory data; however, my data definitely showed a lower Qms compared to the factory data. Although the preliminary factory data showed some variation, I followed my usual protocol and proceeded setting up computer enclosure simulations using the LEAP LTD parameters for Sample 1. Two computer vented box simulations were programmed into LEAP, one QB3 with a 227 in3 volume tuned to 61Hz and an EBS (Extended Bass Shelf) vented enclosure

This also includes Vifa’s Pentacone technology for improved edge damping. The neodymium ring magnet motors are FEA designed and incorporate copper Faraday shields (shorting rings) for reduced distortion. And as with the other NE woofers, the NE180 uses a titanium voice coil former terminated to a unique gold-plated terminal that incorporates both standard terminals and screw blocks. Cosmetically speaking, these are very good looking drivers. I commenced analysis of the NE180W-04 using the LinearX LMS analyzer (soon to be available in an outboard chassis with USB connection) and VIBox to produce both voltage and admittance (current) curves with the driver clamped to a rigid test fixture in free-air at 0.3V, 1V, 3V, 6V, and 10V. As with almost all 6.5″ drivers, the 10V curves were too nonlinear for LEAP to get a reasonable curve fit

Figure 2 displays the results for the NE180W-04 in the two vented boxes at 2.83V and at a voltage level high enough to increase cone excursion to Xmax + 15% (5.75mm). This produced a F3 frequency of 98.6Hz (F6 = 80.5Hz) for the 227 in3 QB3 enclosure and –3dB = 71Hz (F6 = 51Hz) for the 670 in3 EBS vented simulation. Increasing the voltage input to the simulations until the maximum linear cone excursion was reached resulted in 114dB at 35V for the QB3 enclosure simulation and 107dB with a 19V input level for the larger vented box (see Figs. 3 and 4 for the 2.83V group delay curves and the 35/19V excursion curves).

DE120. Think small for a change.
Compact Standard.
The DE12 high frequency driver from B&C has been an industry standard for decades. So, how do you improve a standard? The ultra-compact new DE120 is half the volume and weight of the DE12, while new diaphragm geometry and a neodymium motor combine to produce an ultra-smooth 1.2-18kHz response. While the performance of the 60 watt, 1” exit DE120 makes it appropriate for a wide variety of applications, the compact package is especially important when driver density is an issue, as in small format, multi-driver line array systems.

		<paragraph number="1"><![CDATA[Klippel analysis for the 6.5″ Vifa woofer (our analyzer is provided courtesy of Klippel GmbH), performed by Pat Turnmire, Red Rock Acoustics (author of the SpeaD and RevSpeaD software) produced the Bl(X), Kms(X) and Bl and Kms symmetry range plots given in Figs. 5-8. The Bl(X) curve for the NE180 (Fig. 5) is symmetrical and somewhat narrow as you would expect from a small driver with a somewhat above average Xmax, and obviously with a small amount rearward (coil-in) offset. The Bl symmetry plot (Fig. 6) shows 0 offset at the rest position increasing to a trivial 0.47mm coil-in offset at the rest position that stays constant throughout the remaining operating range of the driver. Figures 7 and 8 show the Kms(X) and Kms symmetry range curves. The Kms(X) curve is likewise very symmetrical in both directions, but with a forward (coil-out) offset
of about 2.5mm at the rest position decreasing to 2.4mm coil-out offset at the physical Xmax position, which means it stays mostly constant suggesting a physical offset of magnetic center, an easy fix in production. Displacement limiting numbers calculated by the Klippel analyzer were XBl at 82% Bl = 4.2mm and for XC at 75% Cms minimum was 2.8mm, which means that for this Vifa woofer, the compliance is the most limiting factor for prescribed distortion level of 10%. Figure 9 gives the inductance curves Le(X) for the NE180. Inductance will typically increase in the rear direction from the zero rest position as the voice coil covers more pole area, which is what you see in the NE180 Le(X) curve. However, the variation is only 0.24mH to 0.19mH from the in and out Xmax positions, which is very good. Next I mounted the NE180W-04 woofer in an enclosure

Figure 10 gives the on-axis response indicating a smoothly rising response to about 5kHz, with the usual (for 5.25″ and 6.5″ woofers) “bump” at 1.2kHz plus a 5dB peak centered on 5Hz. Figure 11 displays the on- and off-axis frequency response at 0, 15, 30, and 45°. -3dB at 30° with respect to the on-axis curve hovers between 3-4dB between 2.2-3kHz, so a cross point in that vicinity should be optimal. And finally, Fig. 12 gives the two-sample SPL comparisons for the 6.5″ Vifa driver, showing a close match to within 0.5dB throughout the operating range. For the remaining series of tests on the Vifa NE180, I employed the Listen Inc. SoundCheck analyzer and SCM microphone (courtesy of Listen Inc.) to measure distortion and generate time frequency plots. For the distortion measurement, I mounted the Vifa woofer rigidly in free-air, and set the SPL to 94dB at 1m (5.2V) using a noise stimulus, and then measured the distortion with the Listen Inc. microphone placed 10cm from the dust cap. This produced
the distortion curves shown in Fig. 13. I then used SoundCheck to get a 2.83V/1m impulse response for this driver and imported the data into Listen Inc.’s SoundMap Time/Frequency software. The resulting

HR124B8-10L
The next driver tested this month is from Airborne, produced in China by long-time OEM manufacturer and high-end audio catalog retailer, Solen Electronique, Canada. The HR124B8-10L 4.5″ midrange (Photo 2) is intended for home hi-fi applications. This driver is built on a 6-spoke cast frame. The cone assembly consists of a curvilinear wood grain fiber cone, a 1.13″ diameter wood fiber dust cap, and is suspended by an NBR rubber surround and a 2.75″ diameter flat cloth spider. This is driven by a 1.0″

Lead wires are terminated to a pair of gold-plated terminals. While I think the wood cones have a very unconventional appearance, I have heard them incorporated into a two-way speaker and their subjective sound quality was very nice. As usual, I began testing the Airborne midrange using the LMS analyzer and VIBox to produce both voltage and admittance (current) curves with the driver clamped to a rigid test fixture in free-air at 0.3V, 1V, 3V, and 6V. I post-processed the eight 550 point stepped sine wave sweeps for each of the HR124 midrange samples and divided the voltage curves by the current curves (admittance) to produce impedance curves, phase added using the LMS calculation method, and along with the accompanying voltage curves, uploaded to the LEAP 5 Enclosure Shop software. In addition to the LEAP 5 LTD model results, I also produced a LEAP 4 TSL model set of parameters using just the 1V free-air curves. I selected the final data set, which includes the multiple voltage impedance curves for the LTD model (see Fig. 16 for the 1V free-air impedance curve) and the 1V impedance curve for the TSL model, and produced the parameters in order to perform the computer box simulations. Table 2 compares the LEAP 5 LTD and TSL data and factory parameters for both Airborne 4.5″ samples. LEAP parameter calculation results for the Airborne 4.5″ woofer was reasonably close to the Airborne factory data. Given this, I set up computer enclosure simulations using the LEAP LTD parameters for Sample 1. This included two

box simulations, both sealed. For the first closed box simulation I used a 169 in3 enclosure with 50% fiberglass fill material, and for the second sealed box, a 100 in3 enclosure also with 50% fiberglass fill material. Figure 17 displays the results for the HR124B8-10L in the two sealed boxes at 2.83V and at a voltage level high enough to increase cone excursion to Xmax + 15% (2.3mm). This resulted in a F3 = 104Hz with a box/driver Qtc of 0.69 for the 169 in3 sealed enclosure and a -3dB = 115Hz and a box/driver Qtc of 0.80 for the 100 in3 simulation. Increasing the voltage input to the two box simulations until the maximum linear cone excursion was reached resulted in 96dB at 9V for the first sealed enclosure simulation and 98dB with an 11V input level for the smaller sealed box (see Figs. 18 and 19 for the 2.83V group delay curves and the 9/11V excursion curves). Obviously, this is a midrange driver that is expected to have a high-pass filter placed somewhere between probably 400Hz-800Hz, so these output numbers would be considerably higher, but for a 4.5″ driver with only 2mm Xmax, not so bad. Klippel analysis for the Airborne woofer produced the Bl(X), Kms(X), and Bl and Kms symmetry range plots given in Figs. 20-23. The Bl(X) curve for the HR124 (Fig. 20) is very symmetrical and narrow as you would expect for a short Xmax driver. This is accompanied by a small amount of coil-in offset of 0.08mm at rest (see the Bl symmetry range plot in Fig. 21) that remains fairly constant throughout the operating range of the midrange. Figures 22 and 23 give the Kms(X) and Kms symmetry range curves. The Kms(X) curve has good symmetry, but also with a small 0.08mm rearward coil-in offset that transitions to a likewise trivial coil-out offset above 0.75mm of excursion. Displacement limiting numbers calculated by the Klippel analyzer for the Airborne woofer were XBl at 82% Bl = 0.6mm and for XC at 75% Cms minimum was 0.6mm, which means that for this 4.5″ midrange, both factors were equal contributors to the 10% distortion level provided this driver were operating full-range, but being a midrange using a high-pass filter, this data is only for reference. Figure 24 gives the inductance curves Le(X) for the Airborne FR148 which shows the typical increase in inductance as the voice coil covers more of the pole piece. Following the Klippel testing, I mounted the HR124 midrange driver in an enclosure which had a 12″ × 5″ baffle that was filled with foam damping material and then measured the driver both on- and off-axis from 300Hz to 20kHz frequency response at 2.83V/1m using a 100 point gated sine wave sweep. Figure 25 depicts the onaxis response displaying a very smooth rising response to about 8.2kHz, followed by an out-of-phase dip in the response. Figure 26 gives the on- and off-axis frequency response at 0, 15, 30, and 45°. -3dB at 30° with respect to the on-axis curve occurs at 3.8kHz, so a 4kHz crossover frequency would be appropriate for this driver. And finally, Fig. 27 gives the two-sample SPL comparisons for the 4.5″ Airborne midrange driver, showing a good match with some minor less than 1dB variations.

For the remaining testing on the Airborne HR124, I again fired up the Listen Inc. SoundCheck analyzer and SCM microphone and power supply to measure distortion and generate time frequency plots. Setting up for the distortion measurement again consisted of mounting the woofer rigidly in free-air, setting the SPL to 94dB at 1m (9.1V) using a noise stimulus (SoundCheck has a software generator and SPL meter as two of its utilities), and then measuring the distortion with the SCM microphone placed 10cm from the phase plug.

PoleSolver Tutorial
By Patrick Turnmire
Note: The Red Rock Acoustics PoleSolver utility program was originally announced in the April issue of Voice Coil. This month, Pat Turnmire gives a more thorough explanation of how this highly useful computer calculator can be applied in transducer design.—VD What makes a great loudspeaker design? As a good friend who has been in the industry for a very long time puts it, “It’s all about dBs per dollar.” In other words, the least expensive way to meet the performance goals is the best solution.
DESIGN GOAL
If you accept this idea, then you can translate it into engineering terms by acknowledging that the best design can be defined as being the one with the smallest diameter voice coil that will meet the goals. A smaller diameter voice coil will always result in a lower mass, a smaller motor magnet, and ultimately lower cost. The voice coil diameter lower limit can be determined by either heating (thermal compression/power

handling) criteria or by a target motive force (BL2/Re). Ultimately, it’s the balance between the two that will make an ideal design. Coming up with the smallest coil diameter that can meet a target motive force is a fairly complex task. Half of this problem is about wire gauge or how much of it you need, which is the “L” and “Re” part of the equation. Essentially, this can be simplified by reducing it to how much conductor (wire volume) you put in the gap. The other half of this problem is the actual “B” value. “B” is the integrated gap flux that induces current into the conductor. Increase either factor B or L and you increase motive force. The conductor part of the design is determined by heating, mass, materials, and other physical properties that can be defined by pretty simple calculations. The “B” part is a bit more complicated and is determined by the “magic” laws of magnetics. Permeance paths, saturation, and flux density are all concepts that are rather complex to deal with, even if you use them on a daily basis. Reducing them to the intuitive level, you can simply use a “current” analogy: “How big does the wire need to be to carry the current that you want?” In the case of the magnetic circuit: “How much steel do you need to get the integrated gap B you require?” The term “integrated gap B” simply refers to the average B in a given gap with a given height and width. From a cross-section view of a speaker motor, this would be the “area” of the gap. Essentially the bigger the gap area the more flux (magnetic current) you need flowing through the metal parts. At some point the flux will exceed the ability of the steel to carry it. This limit is called the “saturation” point and is specified as the material’s “Bmax.” In reality, Bmax is a transition point on the material’s BH curve, but for simplified calculations it is a good reference. Below this value you are getting the best mix of magnet volume to resulting B. Above this value even a large increase in magnet volume will give only a relatively small increase in B. If it’s all about dBs per dollar, then you want the smallest magnet to give the highest B value. From this, you can conclude that the smallest functional pole diameter will yield the smallest magnet and lowest cost design.

Wouldn’t it be nice, then, to specify the target gap B and gap area, and then automatically calculate the minimum pole diameter (based on Bmax)? This is essentially what the PoleSolver Excel sheet does. You input a target gap B, the top plate thickness (gap height), gap width, vent hole diameter, and Bmax, and Pole Solver then calculates all of the background magnetic formulas and outputs the minimum pole diameter required. PoleSolver can also calculate a matrix of minimum pole diameters based on a range of plate thicknesses and gap heights. Take a look at a worked example. The target will be

a gap B of 1.5 tesla, which is on the high side of what you can expect from traditional ceramic-based motors. If you are attempting to build a relatively high sensitivity speaker, it would be a good place to start. If this is the goal, then it’s a given that you want a very thin (0.5mm) two-layer coil for good high-frequency response (low inductance) and a relatively thin front plate of 4mm. For this example, I will specify that this design will not have a vent hole. The value used for Bmax will be the established maximum flux value for 1008 type steel, which is about 1.8 tesla. Entering these values into the PoleSolver sheet (Fig. 1), you quickly see that the minimum pole diameter is 19.45mm. If you want to see other possible combinations of plate thicknesses and gap widths to reach the target B, you can use the matrix solver. This is a quick method that will determine whether other coil options would yield higher motive force by using thicker front plates. For example, if you wanted a 6mm front plate, the minimum pole diameter would increase to 26mm for the same Bmax value. An 8mm plate would yield a 33mm pole diameter.
As a check for accuracy, the magnetic FEA computer simulation (using the not yet released SpeaDFEA) shows the 19.45mm design results in 1.8 tesla through the pole as predicted and an integrated gap B of 1.5 Tesla (Fig. 2).

profile his year’s Munich High End years…Fair (May 6-9) brand names for over 20 Audio experience that’s hard to included 253 exhibitors from 24 countries who showed an overwhelming number of products within 18.373m3. According to Kurt W. Hecker, chairman of the committee of the High End Society, the organizer of the show, this audio fair has grown over the last years into not only the largest of its kind in Europe, but also into the largest exhibition of specialty consumer electronic products in the world (www.highendsociety.de). He also presented the results of a market survey held in Germany. This survey revealed how old current stereo systems were, how often people listened to music, and the most important factor in selecting a stereo system: • The stereo system of a typical German is 10 years old on average. 15.8% of those interviewed had a stereo system up to 11 to 19 years old, and 13.8% had a stereo system more than 20 years old. • The most important attribute when buying a stereo system is sound quality (62.4%), followed by longevity (29.4%). Design was only the most important consideration for 4.8% of the interviewed. • Music is an integral part of everyday life for Germans. More than half of them (50.4%) listen more than an hour a day. 15% of those interviewed listen for five hours or more. Only 4.5% go completely without music.

So there seems to be ample opportunities for the business.
PRODUCTS ON DISPLAY
At a show like this, you need to look hard for the real gems. Due to the sheer volume of products displayed, it’s easy to overlook the products of Constellation Audio. Their booth was far from spectacular, but their products were. I received a tip from Jan Didden to look at the preamp designed by John Curl. I was grateful that Peter Madnick the VP Engineering from Constellation Audio took the time to show me some of the Audio Precision graphs from the Altair and Orion products. Now you can write an article or even a book on these products, but the noise floor graph sums it up nicely (Fig. 1). If you have any aspirations to design the best preamp in the world regarding specs, just forget it. John Curl put the crown safely out of reach—most impressive! By the way, its looks are not bad either (Photo 1, www.constellationaudio.com). Having said that, when I spoke to VandenHul designer Jürgen Utee, he showed me their “Grail” phono preamp (Photo 2).

Again, most impressive. I am looking forward to a listening test (www.vandenhul.com). In another corner I found the 15″ Kilimanjaro-Series field coil speaker (Photo 3). Just a wooden stand with two speakers and a stack of business cards on the floor. It turned out that CEO Wolf von Langa needed to attend two audio fairs at the same time, leaving these wonderful products to be discovered by those who wondered what that power supply connector was doing on a loudspeaker. Field coil loudspeakers do have two coils—one traditional voice coil and one coil to generate the magnetic field. To use such loudspeakers, you need a power supply connected to this field coil.

		<paragraph number="1"><![CDATA[The focus of the Kilimanjaro-Series speakers is mainly on vintage equipment. But because prices for products like that are becoming more and more acceptable (I did not say cheap), they become more and more open to experimentation. By changing the current through the field coil, you can change the T/S parameters. Of course, they are also ideally suited for listening to music (www.kilimanjaro-series.com). A different fundamental approach to loudspeaker chassis design was taken by Audio Consequence. Their 190mm inverted coaxial loudspeaker chassis (Photo 4), which will be available in the third quarter of this year, is not only remarkable in appearance, but also offers a solution to the design problem in coaxial chassis where an ideal position of the tweeter is less ideal for the woofer and vice versa. This loudspeaker chassis is usable in a full-range system (20-25 ltr) going down to 35Hz. Even 20Hz is possible with a limitation regarding output power. And even an Xlin of ±6mm and an Xmax of ±11mm eventually comes to an end. Support of a woofer up to 200Hz can be a welcome addition (www.audioconsequence.de).

For the DIYer, the Ground Sound booth offered a large range of modules for active amplification: digital crossover modules, power amplifier modules from 100-1500W, power supply modules, and transformers (Photo 5). With their Xoverwizard II software, they demonstrated the ease in making a decent setup for an active version of the Focal Esprit loudspeaker (www.groundsound.com).

In particular, the full-hour presentation of Mr. Hans M. Strassner about mains supplies, mains filtering, and power supplies did not leave a seat free (Photo 6). It was remarkable to see that everything he said was soaked up by a very attentive audience. I hope that this part of the show will be extended, because there is a great need for this type of factual technical audio knowledge.
PHOTO 6: Mr. Hans M. Strassner explaining mains cables connection.
One of those areas where knowledge and understanding will lead to an improved listening experience is acoustics. While bad room acoustics are often to blame for a less than optimal listening experience, the solutions are often sought in new equipment, cables, or recordings. One of the companies offering a wide range of products to solve acoustic problems is Vicoustic (www.vicoustic.com). From bass traps and absorption panels to diffusion panels and accessories, they have it. So next time you are not satisfied with the overall audio quality of your audio system, you might consider experimenting with the room acoustics. At a show like this you always find the products and displays that bring a smile to your face, like the Analog Domain Audio Apollo amplifier (analogdomain.eu). Rated 4000W in 8Ω/or 8000W into 4Ω, this is truly a monster with a triple switched class H output stage. Or a product such as the “Magic Flute” loudspeaker from Swspeakers, which looks like a jet engine display that ran away from an air show (Photo 7, www.swspeakers.com). You often see amplifiers displayed with open hoods. Some companies go to great lengths to show their product’s innards. A product such as the Ayre KX-R preamp is definitely a beauty (Photo 8, www.ayre.com). But what to think of a Mark Levinson amplifier taken apart so completely that it looks as though they’re selling the components on the DIY market (Photo 9, www.marklevinson.com)? If you truly are in audio, then you need to look at the products of Silent Wire (Photo 10, www.silent-wire.de). There are many discussions regarding cables and how

WHERE’S THE DIGITAL?
Some time ago, I had the pleasure of attending an AES lecture at the Amsterdam conservatorium by famous recording engineer and producer George Massenburg. As usual, his “lecture” was more a large listening session. One of the highlights was a song by Dawn Langstroth. It’s been a rather long time since I’ve heard a piece of music that gave me goosebumps. I found out that her album was available as a digital download in 24-bit 96kHz FLAC on www. linnrecords.com. I was wondering what you would need to

You would expect to find the answer to this question at a show like this, with its many products on display. For instance, if you look at the record-breaking number of mastodon-size LP turntables at this show, you see that no effort is spared to get the best out of an “old” LP disc. I was rather disappointed that many efforts to play back digital audio recordings were limited to gadgets. Of course, with some effort you can find equipment that will play back a high-quality Dawn Langstroth track, but it seems that more attention is given to Internet Radio, visual presentation, Wifi, and PC software. I vented my frustration to Christian Rechenbach, who is responsible for the German digital audio only magazine “Eins-Null” (meaning one-zero). He was expecting more high-quality digital equipment at the show as well. “May be more before Christmas,” he said. “Most companies do not want to miss the boat and are looking more to each other than the consumer.” But it is a “when” and not an “if.” So at the end of the last day of the show, when all crews were preparing to pack the monster turntables in large crates, some of the workers looked rather happy. The Eyjafjallajokul volcano in Iceland made flying from Munich impossible, but as the sun was still shining after all the heavy lifting, at least there was some extra time to spend in one of those Bavarian beer gardens where the audio discussions went on.

REVIEWER COMMENTS
Disclosed is construction of a transducer that claims to provide a lower mass method for stiffening the diaphragm of a cone type transducer and also provides a larger diaphragm surface area for a given total device diameter (Fig. 1). There are many patented, prior

art approaches for increasing the stiffness of a cone diaphragm but many of the previous methods add a significant amount of mass to the cone, thus lowering the efficiency of the transducer and in some cases, also reducing high frequency response. Briefly stated, the present invention describes a cone-type transducer comprising a frame, a surround having a first end connected to the frame, and a cone having an outer edge in a shape of a reverse angle flange, where a front side of the flange is attached to a second end of the surround, and a reinforcing ring, preferably of carbon fiber material, bonded to a back side of the flange to provide greater cone stiffness and reliability. Another aspect of the present invention is that of having the compliance of the surround being greater than that of the centering spider to lessen stress on the outer edge of the cone diaphragm. A still further aspect of the invention is that of having a surround that is of narrower profile, taller pleats in the surround to achieve both higher compliance and also to allow a larger diaphragm diameter and surface area for a given frame diameter. The advantage of the invention is claimed to be that the combination of an edge of the cone reinforced with the carbon fiber ring and the narrow and tall surround results in an improved loudspeaker capable of increased cone integrity, higher efficiency and lower distortion for a given frame size than previously achieved with prior art loudspeakers. It would seem that each of these elements would generally provide the attributes claimed for the device, and it should function effectively, but it is unclear as to whether it would have any compelling advantages over the best competitive devices using alternative approaches.

		<paragraph number="1"><![CDATA[Reviewer Comments
The voice coil of a traditional speaker is coupled to the diaphragm with a former (Fig. 2). Due to the orientation of the voice coil, a traditional speaker requires substantial space behind the diaphragm to accommodate its excursion, including additional space for the voice coil and the magnet assembly. It is suggested that the space requirement can make the traditional design unsuitable for applications in very small spaces, such as those of cell phones, MP3 players, or other devices where the volume allotted for the transducer is very limited. Another problem stated in the patent application suggests that with traditional speakers there is a complexity of design, which renders the traditional speaker more expensive to produce and susceptible to mechanical failure. A specific example cited is the tight dimensional spacing requirement for the gap between the voice coil and the magnet where there is concern that due to the tight spacing, when excessive current is applied to the voice coil, it may rock and rub against other speaker components, potentially causing reliability problems. Alternatively, the application explores planar type transducers as a solution to part of the space problem, but discusses problems and limitations of that type of device. The present invention attempts to combine attributes of both a standard voice coil/cone type speaker and planar magnetic transducer to result in a package that exhibits both greater simplicity of manufacture and more effective
miniaturization. The essential components of this inventive speaker include a dome-shaped diaphragm with an embedded voice coil on the surface of the diaphragm, a suspension surrounding the diaphragm, and a magnet. This assembly is secured in a frame. Due to the placement and orientation of the voice coil, the improved transducer is said to be more compact, easier to manufacture, robust, and efficient. The diaphragm may be composed of printed circuit boards or other lightweight material with relatively high rigidity. The dome in the center of the diaphragm enhances its rigidity. The centrally located dome segment of the diaphragm can be either separate or integral with the flatter voice coil segment. The combination of these characteristics are said to minimize inertia, increase tran-

The voice coil is positioned as a spiral around the periphery of the dome shape on the flat portion of the diaphragm. It is preferably attached by adhesive, etching, or silk-screen to the bottom surface of the flatter portion of the diaphragm surrounding the dome. The dome-shaped diaphragm has its embedded voice coil disposed on top of a permanent magnet and secured to the speaker frame. The diaphragm, voice coil, magnet, and frame are all mounted concentrically with an opening through the center of the frame and the magnet to provide ventilation for dissipating heat generated by the voice coil and for releasing back pressure built up by the diaphragm’s excursion. Similar spiral coils in co-planer relationships with the magnetic circuit have been utilized in prior art tweeters of the 1970s, but were not developed as full range devices. The voice coil suspended in a parallel fashion over the magnetic circuit may make for a shallower package, and without as-tight spacing, tolerance requirements may make for an easier build, but the claim for greater spacing between the voice coil when used with this type of architecture will inherently be limited in terms of competitive efficiency. If that tradeoff is acceptable, then the structure may be useful in micro devices as intended. VC

t is with deepest regrets that Voice Coil announces the passing of Claude D. Smith, the founder of Nuway Speaker Products. Mr. Smith’s speaker career began over 53 years ago when he founded NuWay Speaker Products (www.nuway-speaker.com). The original plant was located in Franklin Park, Ill., a suburb on the northwest side of Chicago.  NuWay’s original line of business—and still the mainstay of the business today—was making spiders/dampers for the loudspeaker industry. During the first 20 years, the company experienced slow but steady growth. By the mid-70s NuWay began to see a bigger increase in sales due to the startup of seamed cone production, and in 1976 opened a second facility in Antioch, Ill., about 45 miles north of the original Franklin Park plant. The location in Antioch is now corporate headquarters. In the early 1980s Nuway built an addition in Antioch to house the molded cone department and by 1985 were in production of the company’s first molded paper cones.  Nuway’s growth continued at a steady (although considerably faster) pace and in 1995 the company built its newest facility in Antioch, right across the street from the original Antioch plant.  This plant now houses the spider and dust cap production as well as tooling, maintenance,

The Clinton facility was previously owned by International Jenson Incorporated and manufactures molded paper cones and some poly cones. In 2002 NuWay opened their newest plant in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. NuWay currently has about 150 customers and is one of the largest soft-good component manufacturers in North America. NuWay is still owned and operated by the Smith family, with Claude formerly functioning as CEO, Dennis Smith as President and Jim Smith as Vice-President. Nuway currently has approximately 320 full-time employees combined in all facilities, running two shifts. This is Claude Smith’s legacy. He will be missed. Voice Coil would like to correct an error in the “Mobile Audio Sound System Design, Part 1” article by Mike Klasco and Steve Tatarunis in the May issue and apologize to Dr. Eugene Patronis. The article stated that Gene passed away a few years ago. Far from it! Dr. Patronis is most assuredly alive and well and still Professor Emeritus in the Physics Department of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Sorry, Gene!

The first products, a limited selection of in-room speakers, will be unveiled at September’s CEDIA Expo. Although starting a new speaker company is “a challenging proposition,” Gross said, the company sees an “opening” for a company that will “bring back the combination of entrepreneurial spirit and passion for incredible sound, which has always driven this business and helped to create great companies like Polk and Definitive. We’ll create an exciting product that will distinguish itself with its sonic performance, styling and value. We will be very limited in terms of SKUs in order to make it as easy as possible for dealers to bring in GoldenEar and begin what is certain to become a very profitable and enjoyable relationship.” Although Definitive was purchased in 2004, Gross stayed with the company until March 2009. In 1972, Gross teamed with Matthew Polk, George Klopfer, and Craig Georgi to create Polk Audio. Gross started Definitive in 1990. Rockford Corp. (www.rockfordcrop.com) launched its first new Lightning Audio autosound products in several years with the rollout of 23 new amplifiers, speakers, and subwoofers. The lineup, which started shipping early June worldwide, will be sold through authorized Lightning dealers, some of whom also sell the company’s RockfordFosgate brand. Ten amplifiers start at a retail price of
$149.99, with seven coaxial and component speakers starting at $49.99, four 10 and 12″ subwoofers starting at $79.95, and two loaded enclosures starting at $199.95. Lightning also plans a five-channel amp. The amplifiers feature MOSFET designs in a new unibody design. Loudspeakers are wrapped in cast baskets in what the company said is “unique for a product in this price category.” The subs’ “vortex style” cones contribute to extreme rigidity and stiffness, according to the company. In addition to introducing 20 new KF, JF, and QX Series products at InfoComm, EAW (www.EAW.com) announced that it has entered strategic partnerships with Lake, Lab.gruppen, and Powersoft. Under the terms of the partnerships, each of the manufacturers will integrate proprietary EAW DSP algorithms into a subset of their respective product lines. Additionally, in Q3, 2010, Lake, Lab.gruppen, and Powersoft will announce separate agreements expanding the partnership to enable EAW to sell a selection of their respective product lines as components in EAW system sales. An initial round of bids for RadioShack (www. RadioShack.com) was completed sometime in June in an auction that could bring more than $3 billion for the consumer electronics chain. According to a report in the New York Post, the bidders include Blackstone Group and other large private-equity firms, and at least one “strategic” buyer that could be another retailer and possibly Best Buy.

Day hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for the CE chain, the newspaper said, and he and other senior RadioShack executives are supposedly giving presentations to bidders. IBM (www.ibm.com) released its first-ever forecast for CE sales, stating sales for the next three months should increase 4% compared with 2009. IBM expects sales of CE products in the US in June, July, and August to total $24.6 billion. The data is compiled by Dr. Michael Haydock, who is a partner in IBM’s Global Business Services and worldwide practice leader, customer analytics-business analytics and optimization. Haydock leads the business analytics and consulting team, which uses data supplied by the US Census Bureau. The forecast is based on data supplied to the government by 43,000 retailers across the country that sell CE and major appliance products. Haydock takes the data and produces an index from which his forecast is derived. While the report does not give data on how specific product categories will perform, it generally covers TVs, cell phones, personal computers and tablet computers, radios and stereos, refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens, and other devices. Businesses can use the report to make general assumptions about how future sales will go and can make the appropriate decisions on staffing, advertising, and inventory. Going forward, the report will be issued monthly to the public. Haydock’s division also generates reports for specific paying customers.
Consumer confidence in the overall economy remained relatively unchanged in May, while confidence in technology showed a slight drop, according to the latest data released from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA, www. ce.org) and CNET (www.cnet.com).  The CEA-CNET Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) rose one-tenth of a point to 164.2 in May. The ICE, which measures consumer expectations about the broader economy, is down over ten points from this time last year. Consumer confidence in technology showed a slight decrease this month. The CEACNET Index of Consumer Technology Expectations (ICTE) fell eight tenths of a point to 71.5. The ICTE, which measures consumer expectations about technology spending, reached its lowest level since its all-time low in March 2009. The ICTE is down nearly ten points from last year. The CEA-CNET Indexes are composed of the ICE and ICTE, both of which are updated on a monthly basis through consumer surveys.  New data is released on the fourth Tuesday of each month.

The grille protrudes less from a wall than many grilles on the market for a less obtrusive appearance, according to Sonance. The subs, which began shipping in June, are the $700 10″ 250W SUB10-250 and $1,000 12″ 500W SUB12500. Their companion enclosures are priced, respectively, at $700 and $1,000. Each sub is designed for use with a matching outboard Class D mono amp. A $700 250W amp is designed for the SUB10-250, and a $1,000 500W amp is designed for the SUB12-500. Each amp can drive two of the subwoofers. The 10″ sub extends response down to 30Hz, and when used with its matching amp, produces 108dB SPLs at 1m. The SUB12-500 extends to 25Hz and produces 114dB at 1m with matching amp. Their enclosures fit in standard 2 × 4 stud bays and come with a blank pre-construction plate that is included for easy installation. To deliver the rated output from a low-profile driver, Sonance turned in part to a 4″ diameter voice coil, which is capable of handling continuously high levels of power. The large voice coil also let Sonance place dual spiders inside the voice coil to reduce depth and maximize the linear movement of each sub’s laminated carbon fiber honeycomb woofer cone. The inside spiders also overcame another drawback of shallow woofers. According to the company, “In most shallow woofers, due to the short distance from the surround to the spider, the cones have a tendency to rock. This rocking requires the use of a larger gap in the motor to reduce the output of the driver.” The outboard amps incorporate speaker-level high-pass filters designed specifically to complement the sonic characteristics of the drivers. The subs’ enclosures are made of ½″ and 1″ MDF to isolate bass sounds and use extruded-aluminum bracing to minimize airflow obstructions. Mass damping of the enclo-
sures’ front and back walls, combined with fiberglass internal damping, dissipate standing waves, and a floating enclosure design minimizes vibration transfer to adjoining rooms. Definitive Technology (www.definitivetech.com) plans to introduce three more super-thin speakers later this year to join the 1.5″ deep Mythos XTR-50, a $699 two-way LCR designed to complement ever-thinner LED-backlit LCD TVs. The 27″ × 6″ × 1.5″ XTR-50, sized for use with 46 to 55″ flat-panel TVs, can be mounted horizontally or vertically on walls or stands. It’s positioned as the market’s thinnest component speaker that can be placed up against a wall. The additional models will be positioned above and below the current model in price point and length, but like the XTR-50, they will be only 1.5″ deep at their maximum depth at the center of their enclosures, which become thinner toward their edges. Definitive will introduce the new models at the CEDIA Expo in September and ship them later in the year. Strongly rising sales of LED-backlit LCD TVs are producing new opportunities to improve TV sound quality, especially when the TV speakers fire downward like many current models. Definitive thinned out the XTR-50 using dynamic drivers instead of turning to flat-panel drivers. Definitive also avoided electrostatic and ribbon technology for multiple reasons, including expense and a bipolar-radiation pattern that prevents them from being placed up against a wall. To get dynamic drivers into a 1.5″ deep chassis, Definitive incorporated dome drivers instead of traditional cone drivers, enabling the company to place the voice coil inside the dome to reduce depth. Another strategy was allowing small neodymium magnets to protrude through the enclosure’s back panel while remaining flush with the back of the enclosure. A gasket around the magnet prevents air leakage and conducts heat to the aluminum back panel, turning the back panel into a heatsink. VC
