universally professional? Active speakers haven’t been successful in the consumer market because power is relatively cheap these days and every receiver comes with five or seven channels of power. Customers don’t see the need for buying power twice. Furthermore, cosmetics are much more important to consumers than performance. Also, for professionals, active speakers tend to conserve valuable rack space. That is, you don’t need to provide shelf space for five or seven channels of power with active speakers, so they are naturally more suitable for that environment. And there is less need for piano gloss finish. Of course, you know that I have ignored the modern “subwoofer” market where practically all products are active in that they have an electronic crossover, filters of one type or another, and an internal power amplifier. How about price? When I first purchased the LSR6325p the list price was $400, but you could buy mail order for $309. Today the MSRP is $525, but I’ve seen them advertised for $4 Not exactly cheap, but 19. given modern dollar value pretty reasonable. Before I get to performance, consider the speaker’s faults. Nothing is ever perfect. What’s wrong with the LSR6325p? Well, it has “professional” cosmetics: A dark gray matte finish with the tweeter recessed into a waveguide with no grille; thus you must be careful with handling to avoid denting the tweeter. Because it’s active, you need an AC outlet within 6′ or an extension cord. Also, there’s no “auto-on” function. That is, when the speaker is turned “on,” it doesn’t shut down when no input signal is present like modern subwoofers. That means it draws a small amount of power at idle, and if you want to shut down the entire system, you’ll need to turn off each speaker individually. In my case, I just leave them on all the time. Furthermore, while the power switch and volume control are conveniently mounted on the front panel, the inputs are recessed on the rear and moderately tough to reach. Other controls are also recessed on the back (80Hz high pass, boundary compensation, and +1.5dB and -1.5dB tweeter level adjustments at 2.3kHz) and require a small pry bar to flip small levers. The operating controls work as specified, but are small and difficult to read. Otherwise, I can’t find anything to complain about.

PERFORMANCE
Is it true that speaker measurements often don’t correspond to sound quality performance? Well, think about our hearing mechanism. What can we actually hear? Our eardrum is a small tympanic membrane, but only a small amount of sound actually contacts that and the rest of what we hear is through bone and body conduction. So the only thing we can actually hear is sound pressure. But, because we have two ears separated in space, we can also sense arrival time. Our perception of frequency, direction, and distance is actually a function of the brain interpreting arrival time and sound pressure at the two ears and body/bone conduction.
