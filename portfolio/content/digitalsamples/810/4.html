ALMA News
ALMA,	 the	 International	 Loudspeaker	 Association,	 Board	 of	 Directors	 has	 announced	 a	 number	 of	 midyear	accomplishments	and	outlined	some	ambitious	new	 plans.	This	 includes	 a	 new	 ALMA	 website;	 the	 creation	 of	 ALMA	 student	 chapters	 and	 the	 genesis	 of	 a	 student	 loudspeaker	 design	 competition;	 a	 50th	 anniversary	 gala	 event	featuring	the	introduction	of	industry	award	recognition	along	with	a	powerful	winter	symposium	program;	 and	 an	 important	 industry	 collaboration	 with	 a	 Chinese	 loudspeaker	association. ALMA	 management	 is	 in	 the	 process	 of	 implementing	 new	 association	 management	 software	 that	 includes	 an	 upgrade	to	a	first-class	website	that	will	simplify,	improve,	 and	automate	the	member	experience	and	will	better	facilitate	 online	 community	 needs.	 Carol	 Bousquet,	 ALMA’s	 new	 Executive	 Director,	 said,	 “It’s	 all	 about	 customer	 service—meeting	the	needs	of	our	members,	building	community	and	creating	a	favorable	member	experience	so	that	 we	can	focus	on	what’s	most	important.	.	.	our	organization!	 The	 ALMA	 board	 of	 directors	 is	 committed	 to	 providing	 value	 in	 exchange	 for	 member	 investment;	 after	 all,	 they	 pay	 dues	 too	 and	 realize	 first-hand	 how	 important	 every	 organizational	and	member	dollar	is.	The	50th	anniversary	 of	ALMA	has	given	us	a	timely	opportunity	to	review	how	 we	do	business	and	how	we	offer	world-class	programs	in	 order	 to	 constantly	 improve	 how	 we	 meet	 our	 members’	 needs	and	grow	the	only	professional	association	dedicated	 to	 the	 world-wide	 loudspeaker	 industry.	 This	 ambitious	 administrative	commitment	is	one	example;	a	plan	for	solid	 symposia	programs	in	Asia	and	Europe	with	a	stellar	winter	 symposium	and	a	blow-out	gala	anniversary	celebration	in	 Las	Vegas	is	another!” The	 winter	 symposium	 program	 theme	 this	 year	 is	 “Loudspeakers:	Yesterday,	Today	 and	Tomorrow”	 and	 will	 feature	 a	 historic	 panel	 of	 industry	 icons	 discussing	 the	 highlights	 of	 their	 career	 and	 the	 industry	 while	 an	 exciting	 new	 program,	 the	 first	 Student	 Loudspeaker	 Design	 Competition,	 will	 be	 judged	 during	 the	 symposium	 and

awarded	at	the	gala. The	“gala”	is	a	first-time	event	for	ALMA	and	is	a	departure	 from	 the	 traditional	 and	 coveted	 members-only	 dinner.	The	board	is	extremely	pleased	that	Shawn	Dubravac,	 Chief	Economist	&	Director	of	Research	for	the	Consumer	 Electronics	 Association,	 will	 be	 the	 keynote	 speaker	 at	 ALMA’s	50th	Anniversary	Gala.	Specifically	targeted	to	the	 loudspeaker	industry,	with	the	assistance	of	his	team	of	15	 researchers,	 he	 will	 share	 a	 retrospective,	 current	 research	 and	 prognostication	 about	 the	 future	 marketplace	 and	 consumer	trends! ALMA’s	Student	Loudspeaker	Design	Competition	will	 feature	 qualified	 students	 who’ve	 submitted	 their	 designs	 and	measurements	for	a	pair	of	loudspeakers.	Finalists	will	 be	selected	by	an	ALMA	judging	panel	and	will	be	invited	 to	 display	 their	 speakers	 and	 design	 data	 at	 the	 ALMA	 International	 Winter	 Symposium	 in	 Las	 Vegas	 Jan.	 4-5,	 2011,	 two	 days	 before	 the	 Consumer	 Electronics	 Show	 (CES).	The	 finalists	 will	 receive	 free	 admission	 to	 ALMA	 International’s	 two-day	 winter	 symposium;	 and	 one	 free	 night	at	the	Orleans	Hotel	and	Resort.	The	final	awards	will	 be	presented	at	the	ALMA	50th	Anniversary	Gala	during	 the	symposium. ALMA	 will	 also	 be	 highlighting	 and	 celebrating	 the	 accomplishments	of	the	industry’s	best	and	brightest	with	 the	introduction	of	“The	Driver	Award”	at	the	gala	during	 the	winter	symposium.	The	driver	award	will	feature	three	 levels—platinum,	 gold,	 and	 bronze.	 The	 platinum	 driver	 award	will	be	reserved	for	board	emeritus	or	members	who	 have	made	significant,	continued,	and	sustained	contributions	 to	 the	 industry	 over	 the	 lifetime	 of	 their	 career;	 the	 gold	 award	 will	 be	 given	 to	 a	 member	 or	 institution	 that	 deserves	recognition	for	a	singular	and	more	current	accomplishment,	either	within	the	association	or	the	industry;	and	 the	bronze	driver	award	will	be	given	for	accomplishments	 worthy	of	recognition	to	the	newest	or	youngest	members	 of	ALMA. ALMA	 Board	 member	 and	 VP	 Asia,	 Jennifer	 Nee,	 General	 Manager	 of	 Phase	 Design,	 has	 led	 an	 effort	 to	 formalize	 a	 collaboration	 with	 CEAD,	 the	 Chinese	 loudspeaker	 organization;	 the	 result	 being	 a	 commitment	 to	 sharing	 in	 every	 way	 possible	 new	 and	 innovative	 information	 that	 will	 benefit	 all	 members.	 CEAD	 is	 made	 up	 of	 loudspeaker	 engineers	 and	 factory	 directors,	 similar	 to	 the	makeup	of	ALMA.	ALMA	plans	to	celebrate	this	collaboration	at	the	ALMA	Asia	symposium	as	well	as	at	the	 ALMA	Gala	in	January.	The	focus	is	to	improve	how	each	 country	does	business	with	the	other.	A	board	member	of	 each	association	will	become	a	board	member	of	the	other,	 and	in	the	true	spirit	of	collaboration,	will	begin	to	share	 technical	 know-how	 through	 active	 participation	 in	 each	 other’s	symposia	programs. A	 “Call	 for	 Papers”	 has	 been	 issued	 for	 ALMA	 International’s	 2011	 Winter	 Symposium.	 The	 2011	 program	will	highlight	the	50-year	legacy	of	ALMA	by	looking	 back	at	historical	accomplishments	and	projecting	into	the	 future. Technical	papers	are	invited	and	abstracts	will	be	evalu-
