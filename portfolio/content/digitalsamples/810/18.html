profile his year’s Munich High End years…Fair (May 6-9) brand names for over 20 Audio experience that’s hard to included 253 exhibitors from 24 countries who showed an overwhelming number of products within 18.373m3. According to Kurt W. Hecker, chairman of the committee of the High End Society, the organizer of the show, this audio fair has grown over the last years into not only the largest of its kind in Europe, but also into the largest exhibition of specialty consumer electronic products in the world (www.highendsociety.de). He also presented the results of a market survey held in Germany. This survey revealed how old current stereo systems were, how often people listened to music, and the most important factor in selecting a stereo system: • The stereo system of a typical German is 10 years old on average. 15.8% of those interviewed had a stereo system up to 11 to 19 years old, and 13.8% had a stereo system more than 20 years old. • The most important attribute when buying a stereo system is sound quality (62.4%), followed by longevity (29.4%). Design was only the most important consideration for 4.8% of the interviewed. • Music is an integral part of everyday life for Germans. More than half of them (50.4%) listen more than an hour a day. 15% of those interviewed listen for five hours or more. Only 4.5% go completely without music.

PRODUCTS ON DISPLAY
At a show like this, you need to look hard for the real gems. Due to the sheer volume of products displayed, it’s easy to overlook the products of Constellation Audio. Their booth was far from spectacular, but their products were. I received a tip from Jan Didden to look at the preamp designed by John Curl. I was grateful that Peter Madnick the VP Engineering from Constellation Audio took the time to show me some of the Audio Precision graphs from the Altair and Orion products. Now you can write an article or even a book on these products, but the noise floor graph sums it up nicely (Fig. 1). If you have any aspirations to design the best preamp in the world regarding specs, just forget it. John Curl put the crown safely out of reach—most impressive! By the way, its looks are not bad either (Photo 1, www.constellationaudio.com). Having said that, when I spoke to VandenHul designer Jürgen Utee, he showed me their “Grail” phono preamp (Photo 2).
