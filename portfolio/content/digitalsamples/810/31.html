he 3FE20, from FaitalPRO, is a full-range, 80mm driver with a basket in pressed steel, and elevated dynamic behavior. Nominal power is 20W continuous while maximum peak surround is 40W. The 3FE20 has a very compact magnet assembly and a 19mm voice coil operating in tight vicinity of the neodymium ring. Its frequency response starts from 100Hz and pushes up to 20kHz, which must work within its own dedicated closed cabinet. Also from FaitalPRO, the 15XL1400 is a special performance subwoofer driver that can perform around 80-100Hz thanks to its lighter moving assembly. Its Qt is around 0.33, and does not require particular attention in the project stage. For more information, go to www.faitalpro.com.
