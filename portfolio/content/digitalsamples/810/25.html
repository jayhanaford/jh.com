The voice coil of a traditional speaker is coupled to the diaphragm with a former (Fig. 2). Due to the orientation of the voice coil, a traditional speaker requires substantial space behind the diaphragm to accommodate its excursion, including additional space for the voice coil and the magnet assembly. It is suggested that the space requirement can make the traditional design unsuitable for applications in very small spaces, such as those of cell phones, MP3 players, or other devices where the volume allotted for the transducer is very limited. Another problem stated in the patent application suggests that with traditional speakers there is a complexity of design, which renders the traditional speaker more expensive to produce and susceptible to mechanical failure. A specific example cited is the tight dimensional spacing requirement for the gap between the voice coil and the magnet where there is concern that due to the tight spacing, when excessive current is applied to the voice coil, it may rock and rub against other speaker components, potentially causing reliability problems. Alternatively, the application explores planar type transducers as a solution to part of the space problem, but discusses problems and limitations of that type of device. The present invention attempts to combine attributes of both a standard voice coil/cone type speaker and planar magnetic transducer to result in a package that exhibits both greater simplicity of manufacture and more effective

miniaturization. The essential components of this inventive speaker include a dome-shaped diaphragm with an embedded voice coil on the surface of the diaphragm, a suspension surrounding the diaphragm, and a magnet. This assembly is secured in a frame. Due to the placement and orientation of the voice coil, the improved transducer is said to be more compact, easier to manufacture, robust, and efficient. The diaphragm may be composed of printed circuit boards or other lightweight material with relatively high rigidity. The dome in the center of the diaphragm enhances its rigidity. The centrally located dome segment of the diaphragm can be either separate or integral with the flatter voice coil segment. The combination of these characteristics are said to minimize inertia, increase tran-
