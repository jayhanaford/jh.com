frame shows no signs of being designed to prevent diffraction when it is in place. With the grille cloth removed (Photo 2), which Infinity advises for improved sound quality, you see the exposed drivers surrounded by a black vinyl covered material. The light shape of the speaker cones against the black background is distracting and tends to draw the eyes to the speakers. I would have preferred real wood, as I have seen in other speakers in this price range, to match the top and bottom panels. The four plastic feet extend past the bottom of the speaker to stabilize what would be a wobbly design given the 55 lb tall and skinny cabinet. The C336 has three 6.5″ woofers instead of the two found in the Beta 40. The height and weight of the speaker are deceptive. You would have expected a more voluminous cabinet relative to the Beta 40, but a Harman engineer reports that the shape and dimensions of the cabinet “when combined with extensive internal bracing and a volume partition below the bent wood decorative panel, the internal volume is approximately the same 32-liter internal volume as the Beta 40.” Infinity’s proprietary CMMD cone material Infinity has been used on most of the company’s designs since 2001. CMMD is a composite sandwich of ceramic alumina grown on the aluminum substrate. The aluminum core prevents the cone from shattering, while the alumina supplies strength. Infinity has a technology white paper on CMMD on its website (www.infinitysystems.com). The surrounds of the C336 drivers are not butyl rubber surrounds or cast baskets as they are in higher-priced Harman products. Compared to the Infinity Beta, the C336 has a reduced midrange size from 5″ to 4″, although crossover points and slopes are similar. The cabinet construction and an added woofer increase the speaker’s list price to $1,800 per pair. Discounts from list price are often available in authorized stores. Infinity now has a speaker line at a lower price point than was customary for the group in the past. These Primus speakers are simple boxes in vinyl-colored wood and do not have the CMMD cones. The cabinets appear to be less well braced. I suspect the crossover is also simplified. The Primus P362 is the top-of-the-line 3-way floor-stander and has two 6.5″ woofers. It is list priced at $660 a pair. This review has had a long gestation period because of a number of issues and it is more than a year late, which unfortunately brings us to a time that the speaker is being discontinued, although still a value. The most significant delay involved locating an engineer who could answer questions about my measurements. As you may be aware, Harman reorganized after Dr. Harman retired in 2008. I started the hunt for an engineer close to two years ago, but it was only in late February—thanks to the efforts of a new press representative whom I had identified a month earlier—that I finally received detailed responses to my questions as well as feedback on my measurements. Design engineer Emmanuel Millot saved the day. He is now based in France—no wonder he was hard to find. Not only did he provide text, but also 25 figures of simulations and measured results. In this review I will show just three because of space limitations. As it turns out, many of my assumptions about speaker performance were wrong, so I am glad I did not publish without his guidance. I decided to proceed with the review even as the speaker is reaching its end of life because Emmanuel Millot provided some important insights into the design of these new thin, tower speakers with multiple woofers, and the measured performance of the C336 appears to reflect advances in performance over the Beta series. The bottom end of a floor-standing tower speaker such as the C336 tends to be flatter in the upper bass than a small speaker and a subwoofer crossed over at 80Hz with the typical bass management system found in audio-video receivers. A subwoofer reproduces film sound effects well, and the small satellite speakers accurately reproduce the actors’ voices and background music so the aberrations in the crossover area go unnoticed. Many music instruments produce notes in the 50Hz–150Hz range, and a floor-standing speaker is the better choice. To get a satellite/subwoofer system to really work, you need a high-end active room EQ in both the satellite and the subwoofer channels. These highend room EQs adjust the slope and frequency of the crossover to optimize the match of the speakers. I have achieved good results in satellite/subwoofer matching only with the expensive Anthem ARC and Lyngdorf room EQ systems. The room EQ systems in almost all AV receivers lack the computational power to do the job. MEASUREMENTS For my measurements, I used RPlusD, which is the latest quasi-anechoic speaker measurement software from AcoustiSoft (www.acoustisoft.com), which has much improved graphics capability over the older ETF product and can easily average data. I used a calibrated microphone and USB microphone preamp from iSEMcon in Germany that is sourced by AcoustiSoft in North America. Figure 1 is a listening window plot taken at 1m back. I used the NRC definition of a listening window, which is an average of the on-axis, horizontal radiation measurements at ±15° and vertical radiation measurements at ±15°. Harman has a slightly different set of microphone placements to form a listening window. The NRC curve was flatter in my measurements of the C336. I used a very fine 0.05 octave averaging to unearth details that would be smoothed over by the typical one-
