All the charging current that originates in the 9V battery must return to the same battery, and there is only one path—through the charger cable’s return conductor.

FIGURE 11: Charging the MP3 player from a transformer-isolated charger also eliminates the ground loop.

Placing an isolation transformer (available from many manufacturers) in the audio signal path “breaks the ground loop” (Fig. 12). This means the transformer prevents the charger return current from flowing through the audio signal return on its way back to the car battery. All the charging current must flow back to the car battery negative terminal through the charger cable’s return conductor (where it was designed to flow). However, reasonable questions to ask are: Why does the isolation trans-

former block the noise voltage while letting the audio voltage pass through? Because both are alternating (AC) voltages, how can the transformer tell them apart? A transformer only “transforms” AC current that flows through its primary winding. Figure 13 shows an AC signal being driven into a transformer’s primary winding. The transformer induces an AC signal on the circuit attached to its secondary winding. But, notice that the driving AC signal must flow through the transformer’s primary

winding. This is how a transformer can tell signal from ground loop currents. The ground loop current cannot flow through the transformer’s winding—it is only return current. Figures 14 and 15 show the difference between the audio signal current path and the incomplete ground loop current path relative to the transformer. The signal current makes a complete circuit loop through the transformer’s primary winding. However, the ground loop current cannot make a complete loop; it cannot flow through the transformer’s

FIGURE 12: Adding an isolation transformer in the audio signal path prevents charging return currents from flowing in the audio cable return conductor. This eliminates the “ground loop” and cleans up the sound.

FIGURE 14: Arrows indicate the audio signal current path. Note how the audio current flows through the transformer’s primary winding.

FIGURE 13: When current is driven through its primary winding, a transformer drives current through a circuit attached across its secondary winding.

FIGURE 15: These arrows indicate the incomplete ground loop current path. Note how the ground loop currents cannot flow through the transformer’s primary winding. Thus, they are blocked and cannot use this return path.
