JBL LSR6325 Biamplified Studio Monitor
•	Front	panel	volume	and	power	controls.	 Dimensions:	6.8″	W	×	10.6″	H	×	9.5″	D	 Weight:	7.7kg	(1 7	lb)	 	 	 As	far	back	as	the	late	60s,	I	was	making	 my	own	speakers,	first	as	kits	and	then	later	 designing	my	own.	That	all	lasted	up	until	 the	 mid-90s	 when	 I	 tested	 the	 Paradigm	 Active	20	and	found	that	it	performed	far	 better	 than	 any	 speakers	 that	 I	 had	 built	 myself.	 In	 thinking	 about	 how	 that	 could	 have	 happened,	 I	 concluded	 that	 there	 were	a	couple	reasons.	 First,	 because	 I	 was	 an	 amateur,	 I	 was	 left	 with	 designing	 speakers	 with	 drivers	 around	printed	specifications,	and	the	drivers	I	bought	sometimes	didn’t	closely	match	 the	specifications,	so	I	was	left	with	passive	 component	crossover	and	equalization.	So	 while	 my	 own	 speakers	 were	 often	 better	 than	 commercial	 products,	 they	 didn’t	 match	 the	 performance	 of	 these	 active	 speakers.	 Said	 another	 way,	 the	 Paradigm	 Active	20	had	drivers	that	were	delivered	to	 them	or	built	in-house	to	given	parameters	 that	were	part	of	the	original	design.	 Second,	 performance	 could	 be	 optimized	 by	 active	 crossover	 and	 equalization	 that	 was	 much	 more	 precise	 than	 passive	 components	 (which	 meant	 that

gain	was	actually	possible—think	about	it:	 passive	 components	 can	 only	 “cut”),	 and	 the	 speaker	 could	 be	 optimally	 powered,	 meaning	that	the	amount	of	power	could	 be	exactly	that	required—neither	too	much	 or	too	little	for	each	driver.	Over	the	years	 I’ve	tested	quite	a	few	active	monitors,	but	 only	 a	 few	 of	 them	 were	 as	 good	 as	 the	 Paradigm	Active	20,	which	was	discontinued	over	a	decade	ago.

FEATURES
The	JBL	6325p	is	one	that	is	arguably	even	 slightly	 better	 than	 that	 speaker.	 So	 why	 aren’t	they	all	this	good?	Well,	like	all	products,	many	are	built	to	cost,	cosmetic,	or	other	limiting	factors.	Some	don’t	have	good	dynamic	characteristics	at	low	frequencies,	and	 some	can’t	be	optimized	with	user	controls	 (I	 tested	 one	 with	 a	 series	 of	 tweeter	 level	 controls	that	just	couldn’t	be	set	optimally— in	other	words,	at	default	the	tweeter	output	 wasn’t	perfectly	aligned	with	the	woofer	and	 no	 tweeter	 level	 control	 setting	 would	 produce	a	flat	response.	Why?	I	just	don’t	know).	 Finally,	many	are	just	too	expensive. Most	 active	 speakers	 are	 professionally	 oriented.	 The	 JBL	 certainly	 is	 sold	 as	 a	studio	monitor	speaker,	as	are	its	bigger	 brothers.	So	why	are	active	speakers	nearly
