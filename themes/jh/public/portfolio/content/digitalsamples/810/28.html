	<div id="content"  class="content">with Don Givogue, one of three co-founders of Definitive. Definitive was sold in 2004 to Directed Electronics, which also owns Polk Audio. The first products, a limited selection of in-room speakers, will be unveiled at September’s CEDIA Expo. Although starting a new speaker company is “a challenging proposition,” Gross said, the company sees an “opening” for a company that will “bring back the combination of entrepreneurial spirit and passion for incredible sound, which has always driven this business and helped to create great companies like Polk and Definitive. We’ll create an exciting product that will distinguish itself with its sonic performance, styling and value. We will be very limited in terms of SKUs in order to make it as easy as possible for dealers to bring in GoldenEar and begin what is certain to become a very profitable and enjoyable relationship.” Although Definitive was purchased in 2004, Gross stayed with the company until March 2009. In 1972, Gross teamed with Matthew Polk, George Klopfer, and Craig Georgi to create Polk Audio. Gross started Definitive in 1990. Rockford Corp. (www.rockfordcrop.com) launched its first new Lightning Audio autosound products in several years with the rollout of 23 new amplifiers, speakers, and subwoofers. The lineup, which started shipping early June worldwide, will be sold through authorized Lightning dealers, some of whom also sell the company’s RockfordFosgate brand. Ten amplifiers start at a retail price of

$149.99, with seven coaxial and component speakers starting at $49.99, four 10 and 12″ subwoofers starting at $79.95, and two loaded enclosures starting at $199.95. Lightning also plans a five-channel amp. The amplifiers feature MOSFET designs in a new unibody design. Loudspeakers are wrapped in cast baskets in what the company said is “unique for a product in this price category.” The subs’ “vortex style” cones contribute to extreme rigidity and stiffness, according to the company. In addition to introducing 20 new KF, JF, and QX Series products at InfoComm, EAW (www.EAW.com) announced that it has entered strategic partnerships with Lake, Lab.gruppen, and Powersoft. Under the terms of the partnerships, each of the manufacturers will integrate proprietary EAW DSP algorithms into a subset of their respective product lines. Additionally, in Q3, 2010, Lake, Lab.gruppen, and Powersoft will announce separate agreements expanding the partnership to enable EAW to sell a selection of their respective product lines as components in EAW system sales. An initial round of bids for RadioShack (www. RadioShack.com) was completed sometime in June in an auction that could bring more than $3 billion for the consumer electronics chain. According to a report in the New York Post, the bidders include Blackstone Group and other large private-equity firms, and at least one “strategic” buyer that could be another retailer and possibly Best Buy. RadioShack CEO Julian Day is reportedly pressing the
