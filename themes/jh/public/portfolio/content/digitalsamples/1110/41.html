	<div id="content"  class="content">bon shells, as do some upscale Nokia mobile phones. My other area of interest has more to do with ourselves as living beings. One thing I discovered was that rhythms that are prevalent in classical music often correspond with the signaling rhythms internal to the body, which make various organs work together. What most people don’t know is that the heart can emit up to 136 different acoustical tones, and that organs react to those tones. So when the heart doesn’t function optimally, it’s not just the circulation that suffers. It has other detrimental effects on the body as well. My current interest is very much on how those internal body parts work together and communicate, and how that determines “the person” we see and experience from the outside. I recently acquired an interesting combination of hardware and software that can analyze one manifestation of this “persona” through the electrical field a person generates [points to an oversized mouse-like object connected to a laptop]: the Human Body Field (HBF). Trying to draw conclusions from the body field is an old idea; the Russians already attempted to monitor Yuri Gagarin’s body state from the electrical signals it emitted, when he—as the first human ever—circled the globe in a satellite. The people at NES (www. nutrienergetics.com) developed the concept into powerful analysis software running on this laptop. Now, NES does not diagnose or cure illnesses and it’s not a validated medical system. But, that said, I’ve seen some remarkable changes for the good in people whose HBF was analyzed and who were recommended certain remedies. So I find it fascinating enough to spend time on it and to delve deeper into the matter.

JD: Back to audio; do you think that SACD will establish itself in time? VDH: No, I don’t think so. I think we will see the CD continue to be used for the near future and then gradually give way to downloads, either on-demand or as a purchase. Also, if the trend toward 3D video continues to grow, audio may even become just a supporting medium for video, with musical performances reproduced as a 3D holographic event supported by multichannel audio. Interestingly, in many developing

countries (and for this purpose that includes China), we see similar developments as we saw in the western world decades ago regarding hifi and hi-end audio. If you go to hi-end shows in our part of the world, most visitors are of age, while in the developing countries they are generally quite younger. If you go to hifi shows in Vietnam or Hong Kong, you get a déjà vu from what we had 30 years ago. JD: Dr. van den Hul, thank you very much for your time and frankness. aX
