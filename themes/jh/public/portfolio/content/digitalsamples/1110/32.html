CLEAN MUSIC
Figure 2 is a simplified schematic of an MP3 player connected to a car audio system. The MP3 player is powered by its own internal battery, and the car audio amplifier is powered by the car battery. Only the audio cable connects the two systems, and thus there is only one return connection (the audio cable return conductor) between the two systems, and no possibility of ground loops. An important fact to remember when diagnosing ground loops is that electric current must return to its source. For example, every bit of current that flows out of a battery’s positive terminal must return to that same battery’s negative terminal—no exceptions. Applying this to Fig. 2 , you can see that current from the MP3 player’s battery is powering the MP3 player’s output amplifier, which drives current along the audio cable’s signal conductor, through the car stereo amplifier’s input. All this current, because it origi-

nated from the MP3 player’s battery, must return along the audio cable’s return conductor, back to the MP3 player battery’s negative terminal. Current from the car battery powers the car stereo’s power amplifier. This current flows through the speakers and back to the car battery’s negative terminal. Neither circuit’s current is flowing through the other circuit’s return paths, so there is no ground loop and no ground loop noise.
NOISE FACTORS

Now, consider the case when the MP3 player is charging from the 12V socket in the car’s dashboard (Fig. 3). Now you have charging current from the car battery flowing into the MP3 player’s battery. The MP3 player’s charging circuit is pulsing car battery current into the MP3 player’s battery. Every bit of this current must flow back to the car battery (where it originated). You want this charging current to

flow back to the car battery through the return conductor in the charging cable (Fig. 4). But it is easy to see that some of the charging current (all of which originated from the car battery) will flow back to the car battery through the audio cable’s return conductor—causing noise you can hear. The return path for charging current is supposed to be through the return conductor in the charger cable (Fig. 4). However, current will flow through all available parallel return paths (inversely proportional to their impedances), just as it does through parallel resistors. Some of the charging return current flows back to the car battery negative terminal through the audio signal return (Fig. 5). This unintended return current path is called a “ground loop.” This “ground loop” charging current flows through the audio cable return wire. You know that wire has impedance (which is both resistive and inductive), and Ohm’s law requires that
