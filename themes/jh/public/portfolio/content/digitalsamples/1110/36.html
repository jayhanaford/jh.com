What do grasshoppers, 300km wiring in a Hong Kong sound studio, Antonov 225 dorsal wing reinforcements, and a Chinese satellite have in common? The answer is Aalt-Jouk van den Hul, a kind of Renaissance man and audio manufacturer.

By Jan Didden

Jan Didden (JD): Dr. van den Hul, as most readers will remember, you established your reputation in the audio world with your phono tips and cartridges. How did you get involved in that? Dr. van den Hul (VDH): Well, my first exposure to record replay was through my father, who had an early phono player, with a “stahlnadel” [steel needle—JD], and my mother let me play records when my father was at work. This was all confiscated by occupation troops during the war, so when the war was over I decided to build my own player, which I put together from a bicycle dynamo doubling as a motor, a multiplex “turntable,” some “meccano” parts, and rubber bands. I even got it to rotate very close to 78rpm! Later, when I was studying at Delft Technical University, I visited a company in Germany that cut and polished tips for pickup cartridges. They used the well-known “screwdriver blade” shape, which they were very proud of.

Cautiously, I told their design engineer that, in my opinion, the blade shape was just cutting up the grooves at each playback. He didn’t believe me, so I set up a demo for him. We cut a sinusoidal groove in butter from a packet, then traced that groove with a screwdriver blade. Yes, it cut the groove to pieces, so he had to admit that his shape was not very good for the record. They asked me whether I had a better idea. Now, at that point, I needed to be very careful. If I came up with a better idea, they would claim the idea as their own. So, I developed not one, but two, solutions. I handed one solution over to them and they immediately treated it as their own! When they had finished their first tip, they came to me in Holland and asked me to put the tip in a cartridge. This was not a simple thing, especially when you realize that this tip was the only one in existence, and if I dropped it, the chances of finding it were pretty much

zero! I had to remove the existing tip from a Philips GP400 cartridge without damaging the cantilever, fill the tip hole (which was too large) with compound, then drill a hole in that compound and mount the new tip in the right position and orientation. All through a monocular microscope. I remember we tested it on a record from Jean-Toots Tielemans, the legendary Belgian jazz musician. It sounded fantastic! And I knew it would. I can visualize various concepts in my head, particularly how geometries affect sound reproduction, so I wasn’t really surprised. The end result was that the Swiss left with that modified cartridge as well as with my record, neither of which I ever saw again! Of course, the tip promptly became “their” tip, no longer a VDH tip! But I was so impressed with my own design and the way they manufactured it that I started to buy lots of those tips from them. That was pretty crazy because I had to pay them much, much more
