	<div id="content"  class="content">Klippel analysis for the 6.5â€³ Vifa woofer (our analyzer is provided courtesy of Klippel GmbH), performed by Pat Turnmire, Red Rock Acoustics (author of the SpeaD and RevSpeaD software) produced the Bl(X), Kms(X) and Bl and Kms symmetry range plots given in Figs. 5-8. The Bl(X) curve for the NE180 (Fig. 5) is symmetrical and somewhat narrow as you would expect from a small driver with a somewhat above average Xmax, and obviously with a small amount rearward (coil-in) offset. The Bl symmetry plot (Fig. 6) shows 0 offset at the rest position increasing to a trivial 0.47mm coil-in offset at the rest position that stays constant throughout the remaining operating range of the driver. Figures 7 and 8 show the Kms(X) and Kms symmetry range curves. The Kms(X) curve is likewise very symmetrical in both directions, but with a forward (coil-out) offset

of about 2.5mm at the rest position decreasing to 2.4mm coil-out offset at the physical Xmax position, which means it stays mostly constant suggesting a physical offset of magnetic center, an easy fix in production. Displacement limiting numbers calculated by the Klippel analyzer were XBl at 82% Bl = 4.2mm and for XC at 75% Cms minimum was 2.8mm, which means that for this Vifa woofer, the compliance is the most limiting factor for prescribed distortion level of 10%. Figure 9 gives the inductance curves Le(X) for the NE180. Inductance will typically increase in the rear direction from the zero rest position as the voice coil covers more pole area, which is what you see in the NE180 Le(X) curve. However, the variation is only 0.24mH to 0.19mH from the in and out Xmax positions, which is very good. Next I mounted the NE180W-04 woofer in an enclosure
