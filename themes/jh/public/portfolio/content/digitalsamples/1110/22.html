	<div id="content"  class="content">accurately by loading only the cathode or plate circuits, see 1 above. 3. Cathode and plate loads must be equal whether resistive and or reactive. 4. One percent or better resistors should be used as Rk and Rl as well as following input resistors.

A link to 6SN7GTB datasheets is given below; of note is the Average Transfer Characteristics showing rp, gm, and u as a function of plate current. Due to the rapid increase in rp and the decrease in gm below an Ip of 5mA, I recommend that loads and bias combinations causing an Ip less than 5mA not be used. The RDH recommends that loads not exceed 2 times rp.
