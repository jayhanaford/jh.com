By James Croft
he following loudspeaker-related patents were filed primarily under the Office of Patent and Trademarks classification 181 for acoustical devices and 381 for electrical-signal processing systems and HO4R for international patents. This also includes new patent applications that are published in the Patent Application Journal. LOUDSPEAKER INCLUDING A CONE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY A STIFFENER Patent Number: US 7,711,138 Inventor: Bruce W. Howze (Broomall, Penn.) Assignee: None disclosed Filed/Priority Date: February 2, 2006 Granted: May 4, 2010 US Class: 381/398, 4 Drawings, 8 Claims

REVIEWER COMMENTS
Disclosed is construction of a transducer that claims to provide a lower mass method for stiffening the diaphragm of a cone type transducer and also provides a larger diaphragm surface area for a given total device diameter (Fig. 1). There are many patented, prior

Innovative 22 mm dome tweeter
- Powerful outer neodymium ring magnet - Large center hole for effective venting - Reflection-free rear chamber - Resonance frequency 800 Hz - Textile dome yielding response to above 40 kHz - Small size (65 mm OD) - available without face plate

art approaches for increasing the stiffness of a cone diaphragm but many of the previous methods add a significant amount of mass to the cone, thus lowering the efficiency of the transducer and in some cases, also reducing high frequency response. Briefly stated, the present invention describes a cone-type transducer comprising a frame, a surround having a first end connected to the frame, and a cone having an outer edge in a shape of a reverse angle flange, where a front side of the flange is attached to a second end of the surround, and a reinforcing ring, preferably of carbon fiber material, bonded to a back side of the flange to provide greater cone stiffness and reliability. Another aspect of the present invention is that of having the compliance of the surround being greater than that of the centering spider to lessen stress on the outer edge of the cone diaphragm. A still further aspect of the invention is that of having a surround that is of narrower profile, taller pleats in the surround to achieve both higher compliance and also to allow a larger diaphragm diameter and surface area for a given frame diameter. The advantage of the invention is claimed to be that the combination of an edge of the cone reinforced with the carbon fiber ring and the narrow and tall surround results in an improved loudspeaker capable of increased cone integrity, higher efficiency and lower distortion for a given frame size than previously achieved with prior art loudspeakers. It would seem that each of these elements would generally provide the attributes claimed for the device, and it should function effectively, but it is unclear as to whether it would have any compelling advantages over the best competitive devices using alternative approaches.
