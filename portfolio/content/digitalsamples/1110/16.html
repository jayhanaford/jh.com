Power Amp Kits for Beginners
Tiny amps for computers, MP3s, and iPods. Here are some simple amplifier kits you might consider, along with a small loudspeaker idea.
question that often arises is how to improve the sound from computers, iPods, or even portable CD players. Personal music players are designed to drive headphones, but it is often nicer to share music over small loudspeakers. You can use small self-amplified computer speakers, but these are often limited in capability. This type of project is often the first one many folks attempt. It can start out very basic and there really is no limit to how involved it can become. I decided to try out some of the easier kits (with the help of some fellows of various kit-building abilities): two Velleman amplifier kits K4001 7W mono at $19.95 and K4003 2 × 30W stereo at $33.95, one kitsrus kit from Carl’s Electronics 2 × 10W stereo at $19.95, a single channel card from AmpsLab Lm60 rated at 60W into 8Ω for $95, and a pair of gainclones from AudioSector—the chip is rated by its maker at 56W for $59. Shipping was extra for all of the kits. None of them came with a power supply, case, or, in some cases, not even the heatsinks. The first kit I tested was the Velleman K4001, which is a single amplifier that runs on 18V or so. I asked Tim to assemble this kit. Tim has lots of experience soldering connectors but has never put together a kit. He took it home and spent a small part of an evening assembling it. He noted that it was difficult to read the resistor markings because they were so small and was concerned he mixed up the feedback resistors. The kit uses ¼W carbon film resistors, which I do not consider small. I noted the kit instructions say that it comes with the parts on a tape typical of automated assembly with all the parts arranged by part number. The finished unit has six pins for the input, output, and power connections. I soldered an RCA jack directly to the input 16

and used clip leads to a bench power supply and a loudspeaker. I plugged in my portable CD player and got a little bit of sound out of the amplifier. It seemed to have no gain. A quick check verified what experience told me—the 470Ω and 4.7Ω feedback resistors were mixed up. I used solder wick to remove the solder and swap the resistors. The PC board held up well to being reheated and the throughhole size was more than adequate. The resistors were marked correctly but they were a bit more difficult than usual to read because the painted code lines were not uniform or even well spaced. Of course, a good lesson here is if you are ever designing a kit, use completely different values for parts (i.e., 470Ω and 6.8Ω would be harder to mix up). After the swap the amplifier performed well except for the bad habit of oscillating when the input was left unused. I put a 10K ¼W resistor across the input to cure the problem. This amplifier, including the heatsink is quite small, so it would be useful in a small loudspeaker to be used as a selfpowered unit. A 12 to 18V DC wallwart style power supply providing at least 250mA could power it. Although the peak current draw could hit about 2A, this unit has an output capacitor that is the same size as the onboard power supply filter, so a supply with greater current may not offer significant improvement. The power seemed to be adequate for background level music. The Velleman K4003 stereo amplifier assembled by Bryan, who does not solder as well as Tim, was his first try at a kit. This kit was a bit different, requiring a 24V center-tapped transformer of at least 50VA for an onboard power supply. This unit is rated at 2 × 30W into 4Ω. Because the power supply had positive and negative rails, an output coupling capacitor is not required. Even though the output signal current must flow through the

filter capacitors, the feedback loop compares the output voltage to ground so any capacitor effects now have feedback correction. This results in a noticeably tighter bass response. The volume is now loud enough for a reasonable listening volume with a small bookshelf loudspeaker, but certainly not a party system. The inputs and outputs are handled by pins soldered into the PC card. There are ground pins by each input and output. I used a 300 VA, 2 × 12V AC toroidal transformer for the power transformer. Certainly more than the 50VA or so that is really required. Overall, this is a nice start for a small stereo amplifier. In addition to the transformer, a case, volume control, input and output connectors are required. The heatsink was the largest provided by any of the kits.
