too close for the four speakers (three woofers and the midrange) to converge correctly. Figure 7 is a polar vertical radiation pattern supplied by Emmanuel Millot made in Harman’s large anechoic chamber. Now you can see that the amplitude is reduced around 600Hz missing in my data. This data from a real anechoic chamber shows my measurements were inaccurate and shows the 600Hz dip is related to the crossover frequency, the nature of the driver placement of the baffle, and the crossover design. You will notice from Fig. 7 that the response variation in the vertical direction going up from 0° is very small around the 3kHz midrange/tweeter crossover region and correlates with what I measured in Fig. 3 using the quasi-anechoic technique. The midrange and tweeter were closely spaced on the C336 baffle, so the sound converged at 1m. In addition, the higher frequency at the midrange tweeter crossover allowed reflections to be windowed out more easily. Again, the lack of amplitude variation in the midrange/ tweeter crossover region is extremely impressive for any speaker, and especially one in this price range. Subjective Evaluation I mentioned Dr. Toole’s circle of confusion earlier in this review. Harman Labs has a specially constructed room for double-blind matched level testing of speakers. Each speaker is rotated into place so that it occupies the same space as the other speaker under test. Trained listeners hear carefully selected music that allows performance differences to be quickly detected. The Harman Labs advocates test in mono for best discrimination of differences between the test speakers. Random switching is used to ensure that the subject is actually hearing differences. If the same speaker is played again, the test subject should give it similar ratings. The speakers that did well in the controlled environment can be measured

and compared with speakers that did not do well. The process is continued with many speakers until the measured design parameters for a good-sounding loudspeaker are clear. If you run through the AES papers published by the NRC and then Harman Labs, you see how they refined the process of controlled listening tests as well as the measure-

ment procedures for speaker evaluation. The comprehensiveness of Harman’s subjective tests puts a reviewer at a distinct disadvantage unless he/she has a special room to do the double-blind tests. You can try to simulate Harman’s approach with a set of listeners (only one at a time to ensure best seating), grading speakers from behind the screen. Anoth-
